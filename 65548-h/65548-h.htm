<h2><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>This narrative of neighborship with birds is
suggestive rather than exhaustive. It aims not so
much to inform the reader, as to instill in him the
desire to learn from the outdoors itself, to know
<i>at first hand</i> about the charms and the benefactions
of birdlife. The observing reader will supply
what has been left unsaid, and so experience the
zest of initiative, the joy of discovery, in our
mysterious and manifold bird-world.</p>

<h1 title="">HOW TO HAVE BIRD NEIGHBORS</h1>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">I</span>
<br />MY FIRST BIRD NEIGHBORS</h2>
<p>The birds that live in my yard are the loveliest
of all my neighbors. During the springtime and
summer they awaken me every morning with their
sweet songs. Then all the day long their pretty
ways make me wish I had nothing to do but to
watch them.</p>
<p>Now I can imagine someone saying, &ldquo;If I had
a yard, I, too, would try to have bird neighbors.&rdquo;
Listen! Before I had a yard I had bird neighbors
on my porch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>How did I get them?</p>
<p>In summer, a basin of water on the porch railing,
and in winter, the basin filled with table scraps&mdash;this
is what did it. On the porch of that apartment
house I learned how to neighbor with birds.</p>
<p>A kind lady in the next house tied suet and strings
of peanuts to one of her trees. During winter and
spring the woodpeckers enjoyed the treat, while
we enjoyed the woodpeckers! Pigeons and bluejays
came too, and, yes, English sparrows, those birds
that are nowhere welcome. But they didn&rsquo;t have it
all their own way there, as they do where nothing is
done to attract other birds.</p>
<p>One winter day a beautiful blue and white pigeon
with rose-colored neck came in at an open window.
The streets were covered with snow. It was hard
for birds to find anything to eat. This pigeon ate
some rolled oats that I scattered before it, drank
some water, and walked into a corner. After a nap
it ate some more; then took another nap. When
it awoke again I set it in a waste-paper basket by the
open window, so it could go away when it pleased.
It took several more helpings of oats. Toward evening
it flew away.</p>
<p>Among the pigeons that used to come often to my
porch was my little guest of a day. As the pigeons
ate they always cooed. Perhaps they were remarking
how good it tasted.</p>
<p>In early spring the robins came. They liked little
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
scraps of meat. Chopped raw beef was to them the
greatest treat. At the basin they not only drank,
but spread their wings over it and splashed the water
all around, trying to bathe in that shallow dish. It
was only a big flower-pot saucer. While the weather
was still cold, they began to sing mornings before
daylight. It was like listening to Christmas carols
to hear them.</p>
<p>On mild and thawing days they could be seen hopping
over my neighbor&rsquo;s lawn. Most cunningly they
would turn their heads to one side, then to the other.
It is said that they do this so they can hear the worms
and insects move about in the ground. I believe it;
for often I have seen a robin, after listening intently
at some spot, stop to scratch and dig, then pull out
a worm.</p>
<p>The robins often pulled and jerked at the morning-glory
vines on our porch. Whenever they got one
loose they would gather it up in loops with the bill
and carry it away. They also tore strings off our mop
and flew away with them.</p>
<p>On a pillar of our porch there hung a can in which
we sometimes put flowers. One rainy April day a
little wren alighted on the edge of that can and
looked in. The can was empty at the time, so the
bird went inside, but came out again quickly and
flew away.</p>
<p>Pretty soon two wrens came, and both went inside.
Then for several days they made frequent visits to
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
that can, and there was almost constant trilling of
the merriest bubbling songs. Sometimes there was
just a chatter back and forth, as if they were talking
or arguing. These wrens were so much together
that I concluded they were mates.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p2004.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">THEY WERE MAKING THAT CAN
INTO A BIRD HOME</p>
</div>
<p>They fetched little twigs of all kinds and dropped
them into that can. They also fetched bits of cloth
and chicken feathers, as if they actually intended to
make a feather bed. Mr. Wren could carry things
in his bill and sing at the same time. Once in a while,
when he brought something, Mrs. Wren chattered
louder than usual.
It sounded as
though she wasn&rsquo;t
pleased with what
he had brought.
Sometimes she
wouldn&rsquo;t even let
him in, and, after
carrying his burden
around for a while,
he would drop it.
But he sang on just
as happily, and entertained
her while
she did most of the
work. This went
on for several days.
At last they fetched
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
grasses, too. It was a joy to see how happy they were
at their work. They were making that can into a
bird home.</p>
<p>When the little home was finished, Mrs. Wren
loved it so well that for about two weeks she stayed
in it nearly all the time. Mr. Wren brought her many
kinds of bugs and worms to eat, and sang to her all
the day long.</p>
<p>Soon there were some baby wrens in that little
home. Again Father and Mother Wren worked hard
from daylight until dark, fetching worms and bugs
for their babies to eat. Whenever one came home
with a bill full, he glided right in among those thorny
twigs. How they could do it without getting pricked
was a wonder!</p>
<p>One day all this was changed. Instead of going
into their little home with provisions, both Father and
Mother Wren stayed out on the edge, and held a
worm or a bug where the little ones could see it.
After a while, one of the baby birds came up a little
way to receive a helping of the food. But the big
outdoors must have frightened him; for he ducked
right down again. The next one that came out had
more courage, or else he was more hungry. He received
a helping; then gazed about him a little. Evidently
the world looked pleasant to him. He shook
his feathers, flapped his wings, and didn&rsquo;t go back
into the little home at all. This was just what Father
and Mother wanted him to do, and each gave him a
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
whole worm, although the birdies inside were calling
for some too.</p>
<p>The day was fine. It was still early. The babies
would have all day in which to get used to the outdoors
if they would come out now. To-morrow it
might rain, and the next day, and the next. The
babies were quite old enough to live outside of that
stuffy can. They must come out to-day,&mdash;so Father
and Mother Wren had decided.</p>
<p>After the little venturer had received several helpings,
another birdling came scrambling up. He got
all of the next helping. Mother Wren was among
the porch vines, chirping. Every little while she
flew to the little ones, fluttered her wings before
them, and then flew back to the vines. In this way
she was coaxing them to follow her.</p>
<p>Before Number Three came out, the mother had
Numbers One and Two safely among the vines.
Number Four came close behind Number Three.
It wasn&rsquo;t very pleasant to stay down in the can all
alone. The mother kept up her coaxing until she
managed to get them all in nice, shady places.</p>
<p>It was now about nine o&rsquo;clock. The rest of the
day was spent quietly among the vines. After they
had rested a little from the excitement of their first
flight, Mother tried to keep them moving from vine
to vine. One was more clever than the others. He
learned everything quickly.</p>
<p>The Wren family lived in the vines all the next
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
day. On the third day Mother Wren began to coax
them farther away. Back and forth she flew between
the porch and my neighbor&rsquo;s tree, and around
in circles, to show the babies how to do it. Father
Wren coaxed them on with a white worm in his bill.
He was not singing much now, because these growing
birds needed more and more food. Also, father-wisdom
bade him keep quiet lest his babies be discovered
and come to harm.</p>
<p>The cleverest of the four was also the biggest; so
it was easy to tell him from the rest. Again, he was
always the first to venture. But as he neared the
tree, when he had almost reached his goal, he began
to drop; and he fell to the ground. Fearing some
harm might come to him, I went down quickly with
the long-handled dust mop. It was fuzzy, and soft
for him to rest on. With it I hoisted him to a low
branch. Mother and Father Wren scolded, but
went to the young bird as soon as my back was
turned. Birds do not like to have people meddle
with their affairs; but sometimes when they are in
trouble we can help them.</p>
<p>Maybe this little mishap showed Mother Wren that
her babies were not yet strong enough to fly so far.
Anyway, she waited until the next day before she
urged the others to go. Even then she was not quite
decided. At dinner time the three were still on the
porch. They had reached the highest rung of the
trellis. In the afternoon, when I returned from
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
school, they were gone. Father Wren was again
singing his cheery songs. He had kept pretty quiet
while the little ones were learning to fly. Why? Because
he did not want anyone to find out where they
were.</p>
<p>My robins, meanwhile, had made themselves a
nest on a high window sill at the far end of the porch;
but not until the wrens began nesting did I discover
it. Already there were three blue eggs in it. The
robins seemed so distressed at being found out that
we kept away from that end of the porch until they
got well used to us. The wrens didn&rsquo;t fear us at all.
They came to their nest no matter how many people
were on the porch.</p>
<p>I had now learned what the wrens and the robins
like for their nestings; so I fastened strings, shreds
of cloth, some cotton, and small chicken feathers to
the low branches of my neighbor&rsquo;s trees, and also on
my porch. I had read somewhere that some birds will
pull feathers out of their own bodies, if they can find
none elsewhere, with which to line their nests. After
the wrens had cleaned out the can, they helped
themselves to cotton and feathers, and made ready for
their second nesting.</p>
<p>Father and Mother Robin were such devoted
parents, it seemed as if they couldn&rsquo;t do enough.
Their babies always craned their necks and opened
their bills wide as soon as they heard anyone near.
As they grew older they also chattered and flapped
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
their wings. Sometimes they fluttered over the sides
of the nest so far that I feared they would fall off
the high window sill.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p2009.jpg" alt="" width="889" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">THE BABY ROBINS</p>
</div>
<p>One morning the robins&rsquo; nest was empty, and the
young were over on my neighbor&rsquo;s lawn. For convenience
I will call this neighbor Mrs. Daily. She
lived on our right. The neighbor to our left was
Mrs. Cotton.</p>
<p>A birds&rsquo; bath at Mrs. Daily&rsquo;s and the tree with
nesting materials on it showed the birds that they
were welcome there. So the parents coaxed their
young in that direction.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cotton also tried to attract birds. But her
basin sometimes went dry for days. Also, she had a
big, beautiful cat that was usually somewhere in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
yard. It was not so inviting there, according to
birds&rsquo; ways of thinking, nor so safe for their young,
as over at Mrs. Daily&rsquo;s, where the cat was kept in.</p>
<p>I kept our kitty locked up night and day, and
asked my neighbors to keep their cats in, too, until
these young robins could fly up into trees. At first
they could only fly sideways. It is more than just a
kind act to save young robins from harm: it is saving
birds who will be useful and pleasing all their lives,
and who will spread happiness wherever they go.</p>
<p>When I saw how my birds left me as soon as their
young could fly, I began to wish that I, too, had a
yard and trees, like my neighbors. I longed to have
more birds, and birds of different kinds.</p>

<p class="pcap">VACANT LOTS ATTRACT BIRDS</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">II</span>
<br />NEW ADVENTURES IN BIRDLAND</h2>
<p>I got my wish: Our present home is a whole
house, with a yard. We have big trees and little
ones, and on one side there is a grape arbor. All
around us are vacant lots, where thornapple bushes,
dogwood trees, and tall sunflowers grow. These
attract birds. Behind the vacant lots there is a
ravine with wild cherry trees, elder bushes, wild
grape tangles, and other attractions for birds.</p>
<p>The wrens and the robins had gone to their winter
homes when we moved, and the woodpeckers had
come. I had bought a bird guide with colored
pictures, and a pair of field glasses which brought
those black and white birds very near to me. Some
had red on the back of the head. They were the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
downy woodpeckers. A bird very much like the
downy, but larger, was the hairy woodpecker. And
there were birds just like the downy and hairy but
without the red patch on the head. They were the
mates of the downy and the hairy.</p>
<p>Whenever I heard a brisk &ldquo;chsip,&rdquo; I could see
downy approach in graceful, curving flight toward
some tree. Usually he perched near the bottom and
climbed up, pecking and scratching as he went.
Sometimes he alighted higher up and came down
cat-fashion, but always busily pecking at the bark.
The hairy did the same. This must be why these
birds are called woodpeckers.</p>
<p>Knowing how well the winter birds like peanuts
and suet, I fastened strings of peanuts across a bird
table that I had made, and in the tray below I
kept suet. I also scattered chickfeed on the ground
beside a tree, and added to it buckwheat and sunflower
seeds. But I soon learned better than to put
anything for birds near a tree behind which a cat
could hide!</p>
<p>It was great fun to watch the different birds select
their favorite food. The woodpeckers liked the suet
so well that, while it was on hand, they hardly ever
touched the peanuts. Downy also liked the chickfeed;
but he did not like to step down to the ground.
In trying to get it, he would back down the tree until
his tail touched the ground. Then, without leaving
the tree and while propped on his tail, he reached
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
over to the right or left and picked up kernels. In
this way he could eat without stepping on the ground.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p2013.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="900" />
<p class="pcap">THE WINTER BIRDS LIKE PEANUTS AND SUET</p>
</div>
<p>And downy had good eating manners. He never
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
hurried, never fidgeted. Sometimes he stayed twenty
minutes at a meal and ate slowly and quietly, like
a well-bred person.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p2014.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="819" />
<p class="pcap">WHEN I DID NOT HAVE PEANUTS I GAVE THE
NUTHATCH DOUGHNUTS</p>
</div>
<p>Another bird that came to my place in winter had
a light blue back and a white front. His wings and
tail were dark blue, and so was the top of his head.
I always knew he was near when I heard a sound
like &ldquo;gack&rdquo; or &ldquo;yack.&rdquo; He liked the peanuts
better than anything else. With his sharp bill he
would punch a nut, then hold down the shell while
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
he pulled out the kernel. Maybe this is why he is
called the nuthatch. Sometimes, when I did not
have peanuts, I gave him doughnuts. He liked them
just as well. He would nibble at a doughnut until
it dropped from the nail, then go to the ground and
forage there. He liked cheese also.</p>
<p>I soon found that somebody else, too, liked suet
and peanuts. This was the red squirrel, and when
he was on the table the birds would not come near.
However, it was birds I wanted and not squirrels,&mdash;especially
not the red squirrel, who is said to bother
birds in many ways. To keep him away I nailed
tin sheeting around the post of the bird table.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that the nuthatch was not at
all polite to other birds. He always wanted all the
food himself, no matter how much there was on hand.
He would flit from one feeding place to another and
chase the other birds away. I stopped putting peanuts
on the table, so that he would have no excuse
to go there and the birds who liked the suet might
eat in peace. I put all the peanuts on the tree
farthest back in the vacant lot and made the selfish
nuthatch eat there by himself.</p>
<p>Another thing that was not nice about the nuthatch
was his way of eating. He was always in a
hurry. He would take the kernel out of a nut,
walk up the tree with it, and fly away. Then he
would come back quickly and do the same thing
again, as if afraid another bird might get something.
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Sometimes he kept this up for an hour or more.
Even after all the peanuts were moved to his tree,
he would bluster around at the other feeding places
and try to drive those peaceable birds away.</p>
<p>The dearest of all my winter birds were some that
came singing in all sorts of weather. I called them
my little minstrels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicaday, chicaday, chicaday-day-day-day,&rdquo; was
their song. Somebody has named them chickadees,
and the name just fits. If you should see a little
gray bird with a black cap and bib, who comes singing
that song, you may know that you have seen a
chickadee.</p>
<p>The chickadees were not at all particular what
they ate. They sang just as cheerily when they had
only breadcrumbs as they did when they found suet
and peanuts and sunflower seeds. They never
wasted their food. If any fell to the ground they
picked it up. They were the politest of birds and,
like the downy and the hairy, they worked at the
trees most of the time.</p>
<p>These winter birds are some of nature&rsquo;s best
house-cleaners. They work all through the cold and
stormy season when the other birds are away in their
sunny winter homes. Should we not remember to
give them a treat once in a while, and so brighten
the cold days with good cheer?</p>
<p>From the very first, I heard many bird voices
coming from the ravine. So one morning I took
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
a walk out that way. Scattered all along were tall
sunflowers, now gone to seed. Foraging on some
were the noisy bluejays, on others the dear happy
chickadees. The trees were bare, so that I could
see as well as hear the birds. Woodpeckers were
tapping, pecking, delving. All along I heard this
pleasing, friendly music, as if the birds were following
me. So pleasant was my walk that I did not realize
how far I was going until I was at the end of the
city, where the country begins.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="pcap">THE DEAR HAPPY CHICKADEE</p>
</div>
<p>A good way off were some widely scattered houses.
On a tall pole near the first house was a very large
bird house. As I drew nearer, three small bird
houses came in sight.</p>
<p>I made up my mind to get acquainted with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
people in that home. A pleasant lady opened the
door and invited me in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who put up those bird houses?&rdquo; I asked, the
first thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my boy,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;He just loves
to tinker with his tools.&rdquo; She pointed with pride
to a clock shelf which she said he had made for her
birthday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he made that big bird house, too?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made every one,&rdquo; answered the lady, &ldquo;and
he is making more. He is learning it in the manual
training school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her I wanted to make some bird houses,
but didn&rsquo;t know just how to go about it.</p>
<p>Then she led me into a tiny room off the kitchen.
There by the window stood an old dry goods box
that had been fitted up as a work bench, with a vise
and a rack for small tools. Larger tools were hanging
on the wall. On some shelves were wooden
boxes and boards. On the work bench lay a bird
house. I picked it up and looked at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that&rsquo;s to be for wrens,&rdquo; explained the
lady. From a chest she produced another bird
house which she said was for bluebirds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes them out of these boxes that he gets
from our grocer,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and I save the starch
boxes for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady had much to do, so I made ready to go.
But she went on talking:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;At first, I couldn&rsquo;t bear to give up this little
storeroom. But since I have seen how happy it
makes Laddie to have this little &lsquo;shop,&rsquo; as he calls
it, I am glad I gave in to him. Would you believe
it: from the time he begins to work with these tools
until he lays them down again he whistles and sings
like a bird himself! I think anything that makes a
boy so contented must be good for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady then went about her work, telling me not
to hurry. So I stayed to take some measurements
of the bird houses. Both were made so that they
could be opened in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes them that way so they can be easily
cleaned,&rdquo; explained the lady.</p>
<p>On the way home I stopped at our grocer&rsquo;s and
got some small wooden boxes. Two were yeast
foam boxes, and one was a cocoa box. I, too, had
learned in manual training school how to use simple
tools, so I bought also a saw, plane, shaving knife,
brace and set of bits, and a small vise. Then out
of an old sewing machine stand I made a work
bench, and a light corner of the basement became
my &ldquo;shop.&rdquo; I made those yeast foam boxes into
wren houses, and out of the cocoa box I made a bluebird
house. The boy&rsquo;s mother had told me that
his manual training teacher was a lady, and that
she was &ldquo;just as good as a man,&rdquo; so I felt quite
proud of my new fancy work.</p>
<p>The house for bluebirds and one for wrens were put
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
up in trees. The other wren house was mounted
on a post above the grape arbor. But it did not
stay there long, for I soon found that a grape arbor
is no place for a bird house. Can you guess why
not?</p>
<p>It was while waiting for the wrens and the bluebirds
to come that I had such delightful times with
the woodpeckers, the nuthatches and the chickadees.</p>

<br />REAL TROUBLES IN BIRDLAND</h2>
<p>I said that birds were lovely neighbors. So are
some other animals. At my new home I soon became
acquainted with a wild rabbit. Two dogs
roamed around in the vacant lots and in the ravine
a great deal. Often when I heard them barking,
the next thing I saw would be Bunny, running as
fast as he could toward our place, with the dogs
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
after him. Bunny could glide through under the
garden fence, and that was lucky for him. The
dogs were too big and couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I was glad when Bunny came to our place for safety.
He liked slices of apple so well that he would come
nearer and nearer to get them, until finally he ate
out of my hand.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p2022.jpg" alt="" width="730" height="700" />
<p class="pcap">THE BASIN WAS BUNNY&rsquo;S LOOKING-GLASS</p>
</div>
<p>One hot day while Bunny was in our yard, he saw
the birds&rsquo; basin, and went there to drink. He had
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
been accustomed to drink at the brook in the ravine,
where the water always runs, if there is any.
But the brook was dried up at this time of year.
The clear, still water in the basin was a new thing
to Bunny. He took a long look at it. Seeing himself
pictured in the water was another new thing to
him, and he looked again and again. Evidently he
thought himself quite handsome, for even after it
rained and the brook filled up again, he still kept
coming. The basin was his looking-glass.</p>
<p>I am sorry for what I have to tell about some other
animals. One day our neighbor&rsquo;s cat lay crouching
near the tree under which the chickfeed was scattered.
A downy woodpecker was just coming down the tree.
Kitty&rsquo;s eyes glared. Her teeth chattered. But evidently
the downy did not see her. I scolded Kitty
and drove her away. This disturbed the downy, and
he flew away too. But that was better than to let
him come down where Kitty could jump on him.
She could easily have done so while he was reaching
over to the ground for a kernel.</p>
<p>After this experience I covered up all the chickfeed
beside the tree, and scattered some in more exposed
places, away from any trees and from bushes.
I also laid suet on low branches of trees and tied it
on firmly, and poked some into small holes of old
trees, and under the bark.</p>
<p>Soon afterward I saw the same cat again. This
time she was on a branch, eating suet. That set
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
me to thinking: &ldquo;If the cat can get to the suet in
the tree, she will also be able to get to the bird
houses. Some day she might find some baby birds
in there, not yet able to fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not take away the suet which the birds
liked so well. I got some tin sheeting and tacked
it around the tree. The cat could not climb over
the smooth sheeting.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when I saw her up there at
the suet again! &ldquo;How did she get there?&rdquo; I
wondered to myself. Day after day I watched Kitty
before I found her out.</p>
<p>One morning, who should go climbing up that
tree but a red squirrel? When he reached the tin,
he looked around and made a loud chatter. Seeing
no one, he took one big jump over the sheeting and
went to the suet. After tasting it, he wiped his
mouth on the bark as if he did not like it. Then he
went over to the bluebird house. The entrance to
this little house had been nicked by somebody with
sharp little teeth. Now I found out who that
somebody was. This squirrel was even now nibbling
at the entrance, trying to make it still bigger.
At the wren house somebody had broken off the little
porch, which was probably the squirrel&rsquo;s doing also.</p>
<p>I wondered what I should do to keep this squirrel
from spoiling my bird houses. Some more tin sheeting,
I thought, would fix it so he could not jump
over. I put another sheet just above the first one.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
That made the tin protection thirty-six inches deep.
When the squirrel came the next time, he climbed
as far as he could, then looked up at the tin. That
was too high a jump. He turned, jumped to the
ground, and scampered away.</p>
<p>The pilfering red squirrel is not to be confounded
with the genial gray squirrel of our parks, who loves
to take peanuts out of our hands.</p>
<p>I still wondered how Kitty had made her way to
the suet, with the tin around that tree. Surely she
could not jump over the tin! As a jumper the
squirrel can beat Kitty any time. One day I heard
a scratching noise. Kitty was sharpening her claws
on the bark of the next tree. Every little while she
climbed a few steps up that tree; then sharpened her
claws again. There was nothing in that tree that
she could harm, so I let her go on. She walked along
on one of the branches, and jumped across to a
branch on the other tree, the one that held the
bluebird house, and smelled around there. It was
early spring. There were no young birds in the
house yet; so I let her go on, just to see what she
would do. Some English sparrows had started to
nest in the little house. Kitty pulled out grasses
and feathers, and spoiled the nest.</p>
<p>Now just think how wise she was to plan that all
out so nicely! And all she gets for it is scolding!
Why should we blame Kitty for liking birds? We
like our chicken dinners. We praise Kitty when she
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
catches a mouse or a rat. Some people even entice
her to catch English sparrows. How can she know
it is good to clean out a mouse nest and naughty to
clean out a bird nest?</p>
<p>Two things can be done to lessen the loss of birds
by cats. First, to safeguard in every possible way
every bird house, feeding place, and bath. Second,
to compel the owners of cats to keep them on their
own premises, and to lock them up nights. It is at
night, when there is no one to interfere, that cats do
the most damage to birds.</p>
<p>I knew that if Kitty could jump from that tree to
the next one, the squirrel could do it, too; so I put
double tin sheeting on that tree also.</p>
<p>But such a clever cat and such a nimble squirrel
would also know how to climb the grape arbor, I
thought; so I took the wren house off the arbor.
This house also had been nibbled and the entrance
made much larger. I concluded that the worst of
all places for a bird house is a grape arbor, a pergola,
or a garden arch.</p>
<p>A friend had sent me a beautiful wren house. It
was shaped like a small barrel, and had four rooms.
I called it the apartment house. Fortunately, it was
made of such hard wood that no squirrel could bite
through. I had this house put on a tin-sheathed
post on the north side of the house where it would be
in shade.</p>
<p>For the bluebirds I put up two new houses. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
one that had been up all winter was so smelly of
squirrels and English sparrows that I knew the dainty
bluebirds would not like it. The time was near
for the birds to return from their winter homes. I
wanted everything clean and safe for them.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">IV</span>
<br />THE BLUEBIRDS&rsquo; BUNGALOW</h2>
<p>I love the springtime because it brings my birds
back from their winter homes.</p>
<p>One cold March day I saw something blue flash
across the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can that be the bluebird I have been waiting
for?&rdquo; I thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>It flew into a tree; then alighted on a clothesline
post. I could plainly see the blue on its back and
the red on its front. Yes, it was the bluebird. His
song was as beautiful as his plumage, but in a minor
tone:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;De-<sub class="l1">ary!</sub> <span class="hst">De-<sub class="l1">ary!&rdquo;</sub></span></p>
<p>Next he flew to the top of the wren house, tripped
along the roof, leaned over and looked at the little
porches. Then he went down on one of them and
looked into the room. That was as far as he could
go. The entrances to these apartments had been
made for the tiny wrens and not for bluebirds.
When he saw the bluebird house in the tree, he flew
to a branch just in front of it and looked at it a
while. Then he flew back to the wren house and tried
that again; he liked it so well, he couldn&rsquo;t bear to
give it up.</p>
<p>After a week or so another bird came, of much
paler hue, but with the reddish breast. The song of
my bluebird now became long and pleading: &ldquo;Deary!
dear, dear, deary!&rdquo; But it still remained subdued
and minor. Together he and his newly arrived companion
visited the bird houses, so I concluded that
they were mates. They could hardly make up their
minds which house to take, so pleased were they with
all of them. Mrs. Bluebird tried the wren house,
too. But when she saw she could not get inside she
did not go there any more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>My prettiest bluebird house was on our hammock
post, well shaded by our biggest tree. I had read
somewhere that bluebirds like to have one house for
spring and another for summer. So this house was
made with two rooms, one above the other. I
thought the bluebirds would surely like this double
house better than the single one, for they went inside
it many times, and always stayed there long.</p>
<p>The other house, which was mounted on a young
maple, was not nearly so pretty. It was made out
of cigar boxes and I had forgotten to take off the
labels. After the bluebirds had visited it I did not
dare touch it because, if their houses are interfered
with, birds are liable to go away. Both the maple
and the hammock post were well protected with tin
sheeting.</p>
<p>One day Mrs. Bluebird fetched some grasses in
her bill. To my great joy she alighted on the perch
in front of the double house. Twice she poised to
fly, but did not. At last she flew&mdash;and where do
you think she went? Why, to that ugly little house
with the labels on it!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/p2031.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="700" />
<p class="pcap">SOMETIMES SHE WAS JUST GLIDING THROUGH THE
ENTRANCE AS HE ALIGHTED ON THE HOUSETOP
WITH A CHOICE MORSEL FOR HER</p>
</div>
<p>While she was in the house, Mr. Bluebird alighted
on the porch, looked in, and sang a little song. Mrs.
Bluebird flew out past him and almost brushed him
off. Then he went inside, and just as Mrs. Bluebird
returned with some more grasses he came out with
a chip in his bill. Some chips had fallen inside when
I made the entrance, and he did not like that. The
little house must be clean, since Mrs. Bluebird was
going to make her nest in it. Sometimes he brought
a grass or two; she brought whole wads of grasses.
But he made up in attentions to her. Wherever she
might be working, he perched near by, on a fence
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
post or a low branch, and kept his eyes on her. As
she went from place to place to find the right kind of
grasses, or to the little house to throw them in, he
always followed her. Sometimes she was just gliding
through the entrance with a load as he alighted on
the housetop with a choice morsel for her to eat.</p>
<p>One day our neighbor&rsquo;s cat was hiding behind an
evergreen near where Mrs. Bluebird was hunting
grasses. Mr. Bluebird&rsquo;s bright eyes saw her just in
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear-dear-dear!&rdquo; he cried, quickly and jerkily.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bluebird knew that that meant, &ldquo;Danger!
Fly quick!!&rdquo; Up she flew, and away.</p>
<p>The cat jumped high and almost caught her.</p>
<p>After that I chased the cat away every time I saw
her. There certainly should be a law to make people
keep their cats at home.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Bluebird had her house all furnished
she stayed at home about two weeks and took a good
rest. Mr. Bluebird continued to bring her meals
and to entertain her. When he was not hunting
bugs and worms, or chasing English sparrows, he
was sure to be somewhere near home, singing his
sweetest songs.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Bluebird was able to be out again she
and Mr. Bluebird were busier than ever. Both were
carrying food to the little house. I knew then that
they had babies in there, so I called him Father, and
her Mother.</p>

<p class="pcap">BLUEBIRD BABIES TO FEED AND CARE FOR</p>
</div>
<p>The bluebirds caught some of their food in the air,
but a good deal of it they picked up in my garden.
I had some low stakes there expressly for them.
They perched on these and on the bean-poles, and
from there pounced on many a luckless worm or bug
that their sharp eyes espied. I am sure the bluebirds
are great helpers in a garden.</p>
<p>After two busy weeks of baby-tending, Father and
Mother Bluebird did just what the little wrens had
done. They made the babies come outside for their
food, or go hungry.</p>
<p>I think the first little bird to leave a nest must be
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
very courageous. The
others usually follow
close after him. It was
so with these bluebirds.
And as they
came out, one after
another, Mother
coaxed them over to
the thornapple bushes.
She did it by calling,
&ldquo;Dear dear,&rdquo; and flying
back and forth
between the little house
and the bushes.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p2034.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="949" />
<p class="pcap">THE BLUEBIRDS MOVED INTO
THE PRETTY DOUBLE HOUSE</p>
</div>
<p>Some of the baby
bluebirds were quite
obedient and flew after
the mother. Two liked
it so well on a branch
in front of their house
that they stayed there
a while; then flew to
other branches in the
same tree. Father
looked after these, and
Mother stayed with
the other three. What
a chatter they always
made when food was brought to them! It seemed
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
as if each one said: &ldquo;Come to me! Come to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Father and Mother Bluebird had those babies
to feed and to care for, they started another housekeeping.
This time they moved into the pretty
double house and took the lower story. In the second
coming-out party there were four more little bluebirds.</p>
<p>All through this second housekeeping the English
sparrows tried repeatedly to get into the upper story,
and Father Bluebird had to spend much time chasing
them away. In the one-story house he had that much
more time to get food, or to sing.</p>
<p>I did not clean the bungalow house after their first
nesting, because I did not want the bluebirds to nest
in it again. After the double house was vacated, I
cleaned both houses, and found that the bluebirds
had used only grasses and a few feathers for their
nesting. In each case they had covered the entire
floor with grasses, but the cup-like nest was back
against the rear wall, as far from the entrance as it
could possibly be.</p>
<p>What could this mean but that the bluebird likes
a house with depth so she can bed her young as far
back from meddling paws as possible? This much I
learned from examining the deserted bluebird nests.</p>

<p class="pcap">RENTED FOR THE SUMMER</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">V</span>
<br />THE WRENS&rsquo; APARTMENT HOUSE</h2>
<p>A four-room house which had been sent to me
was very much liked by a pair of wrens. Again their
lively, rippling notes filled the air, as these wrens
went from room to room of this &ldquo;apartment house,&rdquo;
as I called it. It was three days before they made
up their minds which room they liked best.</p>
<p>Then they brought little twigs and bits of rag, and
leaves, and other things, and poked them into one
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
of the rooms. It was as good as saying, &ldquo;We will
take this apartment for the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some English sparrows wanted that same room.
We always shooed them away, of course, if we could
without frightening the other birds. The wrens
jabbered and hissed at the sparrows, and stayed,
pecking them and being pecked by them. There
were four sparrows and only the two wrens; so the
poor little wrens finally gave up and went away.</p>
<p>But, try as they would, the sparrows could not
get inside of the house. After a while, they, too,
went away. Then the wrens returned. It seemed
as if they had been watching for the chance.</p>
<p>The wrens soon fetched more twigs, some of them
several inches long. They poked them in as far as
they would go; then went inside and pulled them in
as well as they could. But some of the longest ones
remained partly outside and so blocked the entrance
to any birds except the tiny wrens.</p>
<p>Again the English sparrows came and, although
they couldn&rsquo;t even get their heads in now, still they
bothered the wrens. They couldn&rsquo;t have that room
themselves, and they didn&rsquo;t want anybody else to
have it.</p>
<p>With such a mean spirit is it any wonder that
nobody likes these birds? I cannot bear to call them
sparrows any more, because so many good birds go by
that name, and are therefore in danger of being disliked.
Or, I wish that all the good sparrows could
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
have a different name, and let the English sparrow
alone keep the name he has dishonored.</p>
<p>The boy has told me that, to keep English sparrows
from increasing around his place, he destroys their
eggs wherever he can find them. He said that one
pair of sparrows seemed to blame the bluebirds for
it, and in revenge destroyed the bluebirds&rsquo; nest.</p>
<p>We kept up the shooing and handclapping whenever
English sparrows visited the wren house. After
a while the wrens began to understand that we were
trying to help them, and went on with their nesting.
They put tiny sticks and twigs into other rooms of
their house also,&mdash;and now there was a perfect
concert of wren music all the time. Before night
two more entrances were blocked. Some of the twigs
that these wrens brought had such long thorns on
them that they would not go inside at all. But this
did not discourage the plucky wrens. They just
dropped them to the ground and fetched others.</p>
<p>The next day another pair of wrens came. It
seemed as if wrens had a way of letting their friends
know where some nice apartments could be had. I
was so eager to accommodate as many wrens as
would come that I had made some one-room houses
for them. One was mounted in a pear tree; another
under the overhang of the garage roof.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE SMALL WREN HOUSE IN THE PEAR TREE</p>
</div>
<p>This last wren pair seemed quite bewildered with
so many houses to choose from, and all of them different.
Whenever Mrs. Wren showed preference for
one house, Mr. Wren would go to another one and
with his singing try to coax her there. She was seen
oftener about the house under the garage roof, than
the others. Mr. Wren seemed to like the apartment
house best. He was such a jolly little fellow, it is no
wonder he liked to have company. But Mrs. Wren
did not care for that at all. A small cottage was her
choice. After making us believe that she liked the
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
one under the garage roof, she came with a stick
about three inches long and flitted about with it.</p>
<p>Mr. Wren had already put some nesting material
into the apartment house. But hard as he tried,
by singing and by soft chatter, which I suppose was
coaxing, and by frequent visits to the apartment
house, he could not win her over. Her mind was made
up, and it must be&mdash;what? Well, it was the small
house in the pear tree. When Mr. Wren saw that
he couldn&rsquo;t have his way, why, of course, that small
house became his choice too.</p>
<p>Each of these pairs of wrens raised some babies.
But with all their work and family cares, and the
English sparrows to bother them at times, they were
always a happy company. They could sing just as
beautifully when carrying twigs or worms or bugs as
at any other time. Their happy music made a
continuous open-air concert. And their manners,
whether at work or at play, were so entertaining that
I could not bear to take my eyes off them.</p>
<p>This went on through late April and part of May.
One morning the wrens were all excited. Two of
their little ones were on the ground. Our kitty had
been tethered to a hitching weight; but now, fearing
one of the little wrens might fly near her, I locked
her up. The parents were coaxing their little birds
over toward the vacant lot where the thornapple
bushes are. These bushes start even with the ground
and are so dense, and have such long, sharp needles,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
that a cat would get her eyes scratched out if she
tried to go in. I shall always plant thornapple
bushes wherever I may live, especially for the protection
of young birds. And I shall plant several
close together, so as to make a dense thicket. These
bushes will provide food for birds, as well as protection.</p>
<p>The way these wrens coaxed their little ones to
follow was very clever. They would go near them;
then walk away trailing their wings. This made a
soft, rustling, coaxing sound. But it was over an
hour before they succeeded in getting the little ones
where they wanted them. They had to come back
to them again and again and keep up the coaxing.
I was glad when they finally had them safe under
those thorny branches, where I could not see them
any more for the leaves.</p>
<p>By this time two more young were ready to leave
the house. One was already on the little porch, the
other peered out of the entrance. These were wiser
than the first two. Instead of going to the ground,
one flew to the kitchen roof which was near and
almost even with the wren house. It was a flat roof
covered with gravel. Pretty soon the second baby
also flew to the roof.</p>
<p>It must indeed be a wonderful event in the life of
a bird when first he steps out of the crowded little
home and looks around him at the big outdoors.
Then what courage it must take to venture on his
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
wings! He has fluttered them a few times over the
nest, of course, but that is not to be compared with
just bouncing out into the air and trusting to his
wings to bear him up.</p>
<p>The two stayed on the kitchen roof all the rest of
the day. I put a potted plant out there for them to
perch on. In the morning one of the baby wrens
perched for a little while on a window sill, but Father
Wren coaxed him back to the roof. I put several
more plants out on the roof in order that the fledglings
might exercise their wings and strengthen them
for the long flight they would have to make to the
nearest tree. After a while they did fly from plant
to plant. In this way they spent the rest of the day
and they liked it so well that they stayed another
day, and perhaps longer.</p>
<p>I was absent from home a few days. On my return
the apartment house was empty of baby birds;
so also was the small house in the pear tree. The
wrens were pulling out the feathers and grasses of the
first nestings, and getting ready to nest again. One
pair had already begun nesting in an unoccupied
apartment. Can anyone imagine the hustle and
bustle of those busy wrens, cleaning house and
nesting at the same time, and the joy with which
they did it?</p>
<p>The one-room house in the pear tree was so made
that the front could be raised after turning a small
screw-eye on the side. This made cleaning it easy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Now, aside from furnishing their rooms all over
again, these wrens had their babies to care for. But
they seemed the happier the more work they had to
do. They were just bubbling over with happiness
all the time; and they made everyone about them
happy, too.</p>
<p>I should think everybody would put out wren
houses and get these jolly little fellows to live near
them. Wrens are not particular whether they live
on a porch, in a city yard, or on a farm. They are
just as happy in one place as another, as long as they
have a safe little home; and they will rid a place
of bugs and flies and other unpleasant things.</p>
<p>So cheery was that summer with those wrens around
me, that I hope always to have them as my
neighbors.</p>

<p class="pcap">BLUEBIRDS ARE GREAT HELPERS IN A GARDEN (<i>See <a href="#Page_33">page 33</a></i>)</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">VI</span>
<br />THE BOY</h2>
<p>One day in early April I was in the ravine getting
hepaticas. Before I knew it I was near the boy&rsquo;s
house again. His mother called to me from her
garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy is at home now,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;maybe you
would like to see him at work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>I thanked her, and went with her to the little shop.
There beside his work bench stood a boy about
twelve or thirteen years old. He was painting the
wren house a dark green. The bluebird house was
finished, ready to put up.</p>
<p>I told him I had put up my bird houses long ago,
and that the bluebirds had been house hunting for
some weeks. He said that there were so many
English sparrows around his place that he feared
they would nest in his houses if he put them out
early. But he had just learned of a way to keep the
sparrows from nesting in bluebird houses. He said
his manual training teacher had advised him to
mount his houses for wrens and bluebirds only
about eight feet from the ground, since the English
sparrows seldom nest lower than ten feet from the
ground, and will not be likely to take a house that
is lower.</p>
<p>The boy put up the bluebird house while I was
there, on a young maple that afforded plenty of
shade. His bluebirds were house hunting too, and
visited the house right away.</p>
<p>I told him about the tin sheeting to keep cats and
squirrels down. He said he had been using tangle-foot,
the sticky stuff that is sometimes put on trees
to keep bugs down. But he said that cats and
squirrels didn&rsquo;t mind climbing over it, and he was
going to try the tin.</p>
<p>I fear that the boy was not wise in delaying so
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
long to put up his bird houses. When I saw him
again, in mid-April, he said that one pair of bluebirds
had nested in a house that he had intended for
chickadees; that another pair were in an old hollow
tree; and that a pair of wrens were visiting the new
bluebird house.</p>
<p>Two of his other houses were for woodpeckers, and
a beautiful new one for purple martins already had
some tenants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is two years now that the first martin house
has been up, and yet I have never had any martins
to stay!&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;They would come, go into
the house and twitter, and then fly away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began talking again about his manual training
teacher: how she called one day, and told him that
the martin house was mounted too low, and too
near trees; that martins want to be fifty feet away
from a tree or building, and sixteen feet up from the
ground; also, that it pleases martins to have openings
near the ceiling of their rooms so they can have
a change of air.</p>
<p>I remarked that this ventilation would make their
rooms more comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;and this new martin house
is made according to teacher&rsquo;s directions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we stood there, martins were flying about,
twittering, singing, perching on the telephone wires
near by and on the roof and the porches of their
house. The pole had hinges so that the house could
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
be brought down and cleaned, when necessary, or
closed.</p>
<p>One lovely June day found me again at the boy&rsquo;s
home. I remarked the large number of young robins
on the lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young have just left their nests in that
tree,&rdquo; answered the boy, pointing into a big cherry
tree. &ldquo;Robins have nested in that tree every year
since I can remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guessed that perhaps the cherries were the attraction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we think birds earn all the
cherries they eat; we never pick those on the top
branches at all, but leave them for the birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During that visit the boy showed me several bird
homes. First he apologized for doing it. &ldquo;Every
bird home is a secret between mother and me,&rdquo; he
said; then added, &ldquo;but I know I can trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of these little homes belonged to bluebirds.
The others belonged to the flicker, the wood thrush,
and the killdeer.</p>
<p>We walked slowly and talked low, as we went
from one place to another. Loud talk and running
frighten birds. And to go very near to a bird nest
is harmful because, every time the mother is frightened
away, the eggs or young are liable to get chilled
if the weather is cool. If hot, and the nest is exposed
to the sun, the eggs or young are liable to get
overheated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The boy told me of a marsh hawk&rsquo;s nest which a
gentleman came to photograph. He said that this
gentleman brought a lad along to hold his hat over
the young to shield them from the sun, during the
mother&rsquo;s absence. The two were there only about
ten minutes. But evidently that boy told other boys;
for soon the nest was being visited at all times of
day. At every visit, the mother flew away, and in a
few days all the young were dead.</p>
<p>I remarked that photographing nests should be
done with the greatest care; that if any screening
foliage was pushed aside, it should be replaced, and
the nest left just as the mother bird had planned it.
It is indeed fortunate that bird photography is so
difficult that only few people attempt it. Exposing
a nest to the camera is very apt to result in disaster
unless it is done by one who has the highest interests
of birds at heart.</p>
<p>The flickers had their home in a stump of a tree.
The entrance was so low I had to stoop in order to
look in; but the nest was down deep, out of sight.
Whenever Father or Mother Flicker came with food
they called softly, &ldquo;Ye quit! ye quit!&rdquo; Then the
babies could be heard making a hissing sound.
Sometimes when the parents were gone longer than
usual, a baby flicker could be seen taking a peep at
the outside world.</p>

<p class="pcap">BABY FLICKER PEEPS AT THE OUTSIDE WORLD</p>
</div>
<p>One day during the previous spring while walking
along the ravine I had seen three of these large brown
birds, and had learned their name from hearing them
sing, &ldquo;Flicka flicka flicka.&rdquo; It is easy to get acquainted
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
with birds who are named after their song.
One of these birds on that spring day was constantly
spreading his wings and his tail before the others,
as if he wanted to show the beautiful yellow
feathers underneath. Because of these yellow feathers
the flicker is also called golden-winged woodpecker.
Nearly all birds have a scolding word. When the
flicker wants to scold he says, &ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; as plainly as
a person can say it.</p>
<p>Of course, we never went near enough to any bird&rsquo;s
nest to frighten the brooding birds, nor did we stay
long enough to keep the parents from feeding their
young. We always found a convenient place fifty
feet or more away, and through our field glasses
watched the birds without annoying them.</p>
<p>I had long known the wood thrush by his yodeling
song. It usually came out of the thickets and tangles
in the ravine back of our place, so the singer could
not easily be seen. At sunrise and sunset, the music
of the thrushes, singing and answering one another,
was like bells calling to prayer. From early May
until mid-July I always wanted to be out mornings
and evenings to attend the matins and the vespers
of the wood thrushes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wood Thrush tried hard to hide her nest; it
was completely surrounded by thornbushes. &ldquo;Wit-a-wit-a-wit,&rdquo;
said her mate as we went near; then
he came out of his hiding place. He had a brown
back and a white and brown speckled front just like
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
Mrs. Wood Thrush, who sat serene on her nest all
this time. She was trusting in something to protect
her fully; whether it was her brave companion,
or those bushes bristling with thorns that surrounded
her nest, I do not know. Maybe she thought we
didn&rsquo;t see her at all. We pretended not to see her.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/p2051.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="654" />
<p class="pcap">MRS. WOOD THRUSH ON HER NEST</p>
</div>
<p>Always, when I find a nest, I turn away and try
to keep the birds from knowing they have been discovered.
I look out of the corners of my eyes, and
go away humming a tune. After a while I return
and walk near by, again singing the same tune.
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
I do this as many times as I can during a day or
two. Before long the birds seem to know that the
person who comes singing that tune has never harmed
them. They remain quiet when I am near, and this
affords opportunity to observe them more closely.</p>
<p>Some bluejays were flitting about. Bluejays are
everywhere, and at all times of the year. The bluejay
is that big blue and white bird with handsome
crest. In early spring he sings some pleasing notes,
but in autumn and winter he is just noisy. Now he
was very still. I could just see Mrs. Bluejay&rsquo;s head
between two branches of a poplar tree. She had a
nest there, for there were tell-tale twigs hanging over
on both sides. Mr. Bluejay did not want anybody to
find her, nor the nest. This was why he kept so still.</p>
<p>The boy had scattered some peanuts on a bald spot
in the yard. I asked why he did this during the
summer time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It keeps the chickadees and woodpeckers coming
here all summer,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>As we sat there a bluejay came for a peanut and
went under a tree with it. There he punched a hole
in the ground with his bill and poked in the nut.
Then he went to a currant bush and got a leaf.
Returning to the spot where he had buried the peanut,
he patted the leaf neatly over it.</p>
<p>A brown and white bird about as big as a robin
flew overhead singing, &ldquo;Killdeer killdeer&rdquo; as loud and
as fast as he could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p2053.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="622" />
<p class="pcap">A KILLDEER&rsquo;S NEST IN A POTATO FIELD</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There goes a killdeer,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>So the killdeer is another bird that is named after
his song! How easy it would be to know birds if all
were named after their song, like the chickadees and
the killdeers and the flickers, or after their colors,
like the bluebirds, or after their actions, like the
woodpeckers!</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s father had found a killdeer&rsquo;s nest in a
potato field when he was plowing. We went to see
that, too. It was in a patch of ground overgrown
with weeds because the man had kindly plowed
around it. Mother Killdeer sat dutifully on the nest
while Father Killdeer guarded the premises and told
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
us by his various shrieks and somersaults that he
wished we would not go near enough to disturb
her.</p>
<p>On the farm that day I saw the golden-throated
meadowlark. He is another yodeler. His favorite
tune is:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Le-<sub class="l1">o-</sub> <span class="hst"><sup class="l1">lee-</sup>o-<sub class="l1">loo&rdquo;</sub></span></p>
<p>His songs ring so clear and flute-like that I can hear
him away over at our place. He is a brown bob-tailed
bird. Over a beautiful yellow front he has a
black band, pointing down in the middle, V-shaped.
A large company of these birds were in the meadow,
happy as larks; so they are well named meadowlarks.</p>
<p>But think of a dear little bird and such a sweet
singer as the song sparrow, bearing the same name as
the odious English sparrow! It seems unjust, and
in this the boy agreed with me. We got to talking
about the song sparrow because one was on a fence
post near by, singing over and over this lively ditty:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Twee twee twee<sup class="l1">/</sup><sup class="l2">twe-e</sup><sup class="l1">\twe-e</sup>\<sub class="l1">\</sub><sub class="l1">je</sub>je<sup class="l1">je</sup><sup class="l2">je</sup><sup class="l1">je</sup>je<sub class="l1">je</sub>je<sup class="l1">je</sup> jay.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">THE BLUEBIRDS IN THEIR PRIMITIVE HOME</p>
</div>
<p>The bluebirds&rsquo; home that the boy had mentioned
at the beginning of my visit was in a hole of an apple
tree. By standing on tiptoe I could look in and see
four light-blue eggs lying on a nest of grasses that
looked like a cunning little basket. It was a hot day,
too hot for Mother Bluebird to stay in that hollow
tree all the time. She was out playing tag with
Mr. Bluebird. Perhaps she thought the hot air
would keep her eggs warm. After she went in again
he visited her often with food. Before going after
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
more he usually perched on a little knob just above
the entrance and sang. Sometimes she came out on
the ledge to listen. It was a winsome sight to see
the bluebirds in their primitive home.</p>
<p>This was the bluebirds&rsquo; second nesting on the farm.
Their first one had been destroyed by the English
sparrows. The boy said he had tried in every way
to help the bluebirds, and that, whenever he saw any
sparrows near, he gave a sharp whistle&mdash;his confidential
whistle, he called it&mdash;and that Mrs. Bluebird
got so she understood what it meant; that as
soon as she heard it she would come up on the ledge
and call, &ldquo;Dear, dear-dear.&rdquo; Immediately Mr. Bluebird
would appear and drive the intruders away.</p>
<p>These bluebirds were also annoyed by a red squirrel
who climbed the trees in the orchard and peered
into the nest holes. Mr. Bluebird dashed for him
whenever he saw him, especially if he found him
near the home tree. Sometimes both the bluebirds
chased the red squirrel, who would run off barking
like a little dog.</p>
<p>The boy had seen how I put out strings and cotton
and chicken feathers, for the birds&rsquo; nestings, and he
had fixed up a &ldquo;store&rdquo;&mdash;as he called it&mdash;on a tree,
where they could &ldquo;buy without money.&rdquo; Every
little while a goldfinch came and got some string.
Always on coming he sang out, &ldquo;Perchikatee,&rdquo; as if
to say, &ldquo;By your leave.&rdquo; Downy woodpeckers,
chickadees, and nuthatches were there at this time of
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
the year, although ordinarily they are seen only in
winter and early spring.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">

<p class="pcap">EVERY LITTLE WHILE A GOLDFINCH CAME TO
THE &ldquo;STORE&rdquo; TREE AND GOT SOME STRING</p>
</div>
<p>The boy said it was the ravine, with its trees and
thickets and tangles, that attracted so many birds.
He was always praising that ravine. He thought
so much of it that he had asked the neighbors not to
throw rubbish down there, and not to disturb the
underbrush, which shelters so many birds. He had
also asked them please to keep their cats indoors at
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
night, because so many birds had nests and helpless
little ones on the ground, or in low bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother put me up to that,&rdquo; he said; and added,
&ldquo;we are trying to keep that ravine as a sanctuary
for birds, where they and their little ones can be
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another thing that attracted birds to that place
was a mulberry tree. Though only two years old,
it was bearing fruit and was visited by robins, orioles,
thrashers, and redheaded woodpeckers.</p>
<p>The boy had so many kinds of birds never seen
near our place that I began to wish I, too, could live
on a farm and have so many more of these charming
neighbors.</p>
<p>A storm came up. Soon the shallow places in a
cornfield near by were turned into puddles. The
baby martins that had been lounging on the porch
went inside. The old ones came flying home in a
hurry. We went to the garden house, which the
boy had fitted up as a workshop because he didn&rsquo;t
like to deprive his mother any longer of her little
storeroom. When it stopped raining the sun came
out and the clean earth fairly glistened. A flock of
robins came to hunt for worms in the drenched field.
Some bathed in the puddles. It was amusing to
watch them chase one away if he stayed in long.</p>
<p>As we were enjoying the robins, the boy&rsquo;s mother
called out: &ldquo;Come here, you bird people, and see
what has happened.&rdquo; She took us to the living room
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
and told us to listen at the chimney. A rasping
twitter came from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be those chimney swallows,&rdquo; guessed the
boy.</p>
<p>He stepped upon a chair and took off the chimney
cap. There, scrambling around in soot, were some
black looking birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three, four,&rdquo; he counted, as he reached
in and handed them out on a newspaper.</p>
<p>Three were young birds, and one was an adult
bird with long wings. Their nest was also there.
The heavy rain had loosened it and made it fall.</p>
<p>The little ones screeched in chorus, and tried constantly
to get hold of something with their claws.
The older bird gave no sound at all. She seemed to
be hurt. We called her the mother.</p>
<p>The lady looked at their little nest. Then she
went and fetched a basket, and, as soon as the birds
were removed to it, they began to clamber up the
sides. When they got to the top, where they could
hang at full length, they stopped their screeching.
Only now and then they still gave a rasping sound.
Perhaps they were hungry, and scolded because
nobody brought them any food. Some crossed over
the rim of the basket and tried the other side.</p>
<p>I stayed there the rest of the afternoon. Every
ten or fifteen minutes the little birds gave a call,
like, &ldquo;Gitse gitse.&rdquo; Thinking that they must be
almost choked with the soot, I tried to give them
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
water, but they would not open their bills. I forced
them open with a manicure stick, and gave them a
drop at a time. They swallowed it when it was
dropped far down in their throats; otherwise they
would jerk their heads and throw it out.</p>
<p>I also moistened a cracker with some egg yolk,
and mixed into it about fifty flies out of the flytrap;
then tried to feed the birds with the little stick. By
prying up their upper mandible I got some flies down
each bird&rsquo;s throat. The lower mandible was very
soft and would not bear handling.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE CHIMNEY SWIFTS&rsquo; TEMPORARY HOME</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>I became so attached to these birds, I hated to
leave them, but the time came for me to go home.
The boy and his mother seemed distressed at the
prospect of having birds as boarders. There was
canning to do, besides cooking for extra farm hands;
and Laddie had to help his father with the haying,&mdash;so
his mother said.</p>
<p>I offered to take the birds and do the best I could
with them, if the lad was willing. He was; so I took
the birds and the nest with me in the little basket,
which was their temporary home.</p>

<p class="pcap">CHIMNEY SWIFTS&rsquo; NEST</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">VII</span>
<br />THE CHIMNEY SWIFTS</h2>
<p>The correct name of these birds whose home life
was so rudely broken up is chimney swift. According
to the bird books, they have been known to fly a
thousand miles in a day, and they live in chimneys.
Could any name fit them better? Chimney swifts
are sometimes called swallows, probably because they
resemble them somewhat, and twitter like swallows.
But they are not swallows at all.</p>
<p>I thought if the birds could have their nest near
them, it would seem more like home to them. It
was a tiny nest, a bracket made of twigs which were
woven together basket fashion and tightly glued. I
have preserved it as an art treasure. On each side
is a flat, gluey extension. Wetting this extension
made it sticky; but it would not stick to the rough
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
surface of the small basket. I laid it on the smooth
surface inside a peach basket and put weights on it.
When it became dry, the nest was stuck fast.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/p2063.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="619" />
<p class="pcap">ONE OF THESE SWIFT BABIES WAS PUT TO REST IN THE
NEST, BUT HE DID NOT STAY THERE LONG</p>
</div>
<p>Then I transferred the swifts from the small basket,
which had been their temporary home, to the peach
basket. They perched around the nest. One of these
babies was put to rest in the nest, but he did not
stay there long. They all clambered up to the edge
and from time to time they changed places, sometimes
crossing over the edge of the basket from one side to
the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>It was fortunate that this happened during my
vacation, because the care of a baby bird demands
much time. He has to be fed regularly and often.
Having several birds to feed is about enough to take
up all one&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>If they only had opened their bills when they were
hungry, it would have been much easier to feed these
swifts. Their very short but wide bills had to be
pried open every time and the food poked down their
throats. I tried to feed them every fifteen or twenty
minutes. It took so long to feed each one, that
usually, by the time I had finished with number
four, it was necessary to begin feeding number one
again.</p>
<p>The food I gave them was bread soaked in warm
milk, with plenty of flies mixed in. For a change I
mixed the bread with a raw yolk. I gave them warm
water occasionally. It seemed to me they needed it
after having come through that mass of soot.</p>
<p>At the end of the first day the young were as
chipper and bright as any young birds. Instead of
screeching they began to twitter, &ldquo;Gitse gitse.&rdquo; The
mother was very still. She did not seem to care for
her babies at all, and did not go near to keep them
warm. She just hung in the one position. Several
times she tried to fly, but she could only fly a few
feet; then she fell to the floor.</p>
<p>During the second day the young seemed to be
doing well. They preened themselves, and their
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
blackish breasts were changed to gray. It was a
cool day, and I set the basket where the sun would
shine on the birds. They fluffed their feathers as if
they enjoyed the warmth. Once in a while one
tried to fly, but he always fluttered to the ground
and had to be brought back. The mother tried her
wings again and again. She got so she could fly a little
farther at every attempt, before she went to the
ground. At about five o&rsquo;clock she flew far enough
to get out of sight.</p>
<p>All the next day I kept the peach basket with
these swifts in it outdoors, hoping the mother would
return and feed them. But she did not return.</p>
<p>On the following day these birds began to look
feeble. I went to the telephone and called up a
gentleman<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> who is an authority on birds, and asked
him what I should do. He said the main thing was
to keep the birds evenly warm; that more young
birds die from chill than from hunger. To revive
them he said I should put a few drops of whiskey in
a glass of water and give them each a few drops;
then I should try to get them some gnats, or a
grub from the garden, mince it well, and feed it to
them. Flies, he said, had not much nourishment in
them.</p>
<p>On returning I found that two of the little birds
had died. I determined to try hard to save the remaining
one. It was impossible to get whiskey
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
because I live in a temperance town. I gave the
little bird a weak solution of baking soda because
he had a big lump in his craw. Then I wrapped him
in a silken scarf, and warmed him beside the cook
stove as I have seen baby chicks revived when they
have been chilled by a sudden rain. The lump disappeared.
He brightened up. I could find no grubs;
but a few grasshoppers, some ant larv&aelig;, and several
juicy green cabbage worms were food enough for
the rest of that day. I kept the bird in his wrappings
all day, but fixed it so he could clamber on to
the basket. At night I put him away warm and snug,
and seemingly happy. The first sound I heard the
next morning was &ldquo;Gitse gitse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little bird was ready for a meal. From an ant
hill near by I got more ant larv&aelig;, something which
all young birds like. For the first time now he
swallowed food just as soon as it got inside his bill.
Up to this time he had jerked it out unless it was
poked down. But he still refused to open his bill.</p>
<p>He did not care for the nest and never would stay
on it. So I fixed him again in the little basket
where he would be more snug. I had lined it with
cotton batting and woolen cloth so his breast would
be against a soft, warm surface. I also kept him at
an even temperature, and fed him regularly. The
little basket was on my work table. He seemed to
enjoy being near me and being talked to. Sometimes
he flew over on my shoulder. I fed him more cabbage
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
worms and grasshoppers, and also gave him water
occasionally.</p>
<p>I could not forgive myself to think I hadn&rsquo;t asked
for advice sooner. I felt sure that, had I done so the
first day I took charge of these birds, and then followed
instructions, the two would not have died.</p>
<p>Again at the close of the day Baby Swift was put
away in his warm wrappings. In the morning I did
not hear the usual, &ldquo;Gitse gitse.&rdquo; Baby Swift had
gone to the bird heaven.</p>
<p>It had been a big undertaking to adopt those
homeless birds; but I am glad for several reasons
that I did it.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, I am glad that I helped them in their trouble.</p>
<p><i>Second</i>, I am glad I relieved the boy and his busy
mother of caring for them.</p>
<p><i>Third</i>, I am glad because I have since read in the
bird books that the chimney swift is a very useful
bird; that he feeds wholly on troublesome insects.</p>
<p><i>Fourth</i>, I am glad because it gave me opportunity
to get acquainted with one more bird. I consider
that something worth while.</p>

<p class="pcap">A ROBIN&rsquo;S NEST</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">VIII</span>
<br />BIRDS NOT OF A FEATHER</h2>
<p>One day, on looking up into a tree in the vacant
lot, what should I see there? A mother robin just
dropping a worm into her baby&rsquo;s open beak.</p>
<p>The nest was right in the crotch where the trunk
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
forks into two main branches. So many robins&rsquo;
nests are blown off the branches by the wind, or
washed off by heavy rains, that I was glad to see
this nest firmly saddled on that strong trunk. But
a second thought told me that it was easy for cats
and squirrels to get at, so I studied how to make it
safe.</p>
<p>All the tin sheeting had been used up; but I knew
where there was some old stove pipe. A kind
neighbor ripped it open. One piece was not wide
enough to go around the tree, so I had to use two.
Mrs. Cotton, who had again become my neighbor,
having built a bungalow on one of the vacant lots,
came to help me. She said it wasn&rsquo;t good for the
tree to drive nails into it, and fetched some wire.
Meanwhile, I got the stepladder; for the sheeting must
be high enough so that cats and squirrels cannot
jump from the ground to the trunk above it. We
used only two small nails, to keep the wires from
slipping.</p>
<p>Of course, the robins scolded while we were doing
this. They never liked to have anybody near their
tree.</p>
<p>After a week the young ones were sitting on the
edge of the nest. I knew then that they would soon
leave it, and I began to keep a close watch on them,
and on the cats of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>If all cats belonged to people, and had to be kept
on their own premises, little birds would be much
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
safer. As it is, cats may roam wherever they please.
They can crouch in tall grasses, flower beds, shrubs,
and other places, ready to pounce on any bird that
comes near enough. Homeless cats who have to
hunt their living are the greatest menace to birds,
especially to young birds who are not yet wise to
the dangers that surround them. Now who is to
blame? Surely not the cats. Instead of continually
berating the cats, let the friends of birds secure laws
to license cats, to compel people to keep their cats
on their own premises, to punish people for putting
cats astray, and to put homeless cats out of their
misery.</p>
<p>One June day, while walking along the ravine,
I saw three robins on the ground. I went to the
tree to see if the young had all left the nest, and
found that one was still there. He looked down, as
if he would like to go to join his brothers; but he
seemed to be afraid to leave the safe little home.
The parents brought food to him and also to those
on the ground. Whenever the parents went to the
one on the nest, they urged him to come over to
some of the near branches; but he stayed on the nest
as if glued to it. Finally, one of the parents got behind
him and just politely pushed him off. He spread
his wings to fly, but fluttered to the ground. Instead
of continuing my walk that morning I stayed with
the robins. About a hundred feet away I could see
them well with my field glasses. My neighbor,
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
Mrs. Cotton, was just as much interested in these
birds as I was. They could not fly well yet. Between
us we saw to it that no harm befell them that
day.</p>
<p>Towards evening the robins also sought the protection
of those bristly thornapple bushes. One by
one they coaxed the young in that direction.</p>
<p>During that night a great storm came up of lightning
and thunder and rain. I was sorry for the young
robins, but had no doubt that their parents shielded
them. I have seen a mother bird sit faithfully on
the nest when the rain was pelting her mercilessly.
Mother love knows no discomforts.</p>
<p>I think all birds enjoy a good shower; they always
sing joyously as soon as it clears again, and sometimes
while it is still raining. Some also enjoy a shower
bath. Sometimes they finish it with a ducking in
the basin. Those that do not care for the shower
usually know where to find a comfortable place during
a heavy downpour. On such occasions, I have seen
them take refuge in trees, close to the trunk where it
is steady and where the foliage is dense over them.
And I have seen them go for shelter under rail fences,
such as there are in the country, where the rails are
broad enough to protect a little bird. I have also
seen birds come out from under a corn-crib after a
rain, so I presume they had gone under it for shelter.</p>
<p>After the robins had left their nest I took the
sheeting off the tree. It is said that the bark of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
tree is its lungs through which it breathes. I want
all the trees around me to breathe deeply of the
precious air, so I try always to save the bark. It is
much easier to take off the wires than it is to take
nails out of a tree. Already some insects had made
nests and cocoons under this sheeting.</p>
<p>My way of getting acquainted with birds was by
keeping a notebook. In it I wrote everything I saw
any bird do: what he ate, how he sang, what he
looked like, where he was generally seen, etc. I
always watched a bird as long as it stayed in sight.
When it left I observed its flight and its shape. Then
I looked at the colored pictures in my bird books, to
see if I could find a bird similar to mine. If I did
find him, then I read all about him to see whether
that bird ate the kind of food, and acted, and flew,
and sang, in the way my strange bird did. If he did,
then I knew I had made the acquaintance of a new
bird.</p>
<p>For instance, I had written about one bird:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather plump, head pointed, bill long. Head and
back olive. Front yellow. Wings dark with white
bars. Tail brown with dark marks. Is on the fence
getting strings. Also visits the basin. Never sings.
Likes bread crumbs. Nearly as large as robin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes there came with this bird a beautiful
black and orange bird. In a little pocket guide I
found both these birds pictured as mates. They
were the Baltimore orioles. She was the bird I had
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
described in my notebook. While she was getting
strings, her mate was usually up in a tree somewhere
near, singing:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Hee<sub class="l1">\ho/</sub>hee, hee<sub class="l1">\ho ho/</sub>hee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no wonder that the orioles needed so many
strings. They made a baglike nest on the tip end of
a branch in Mrs. Cotton&rsquo;s elm. The wind used to
swing that nest like a hammock. I often thought
how nice it must be for those baby orioles to be
rocked by the wind and to have such a fine musician
for their father.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cotton was keeping her cat housed during
those days. Moreover, she threw bread out on her
lawn every day for any birds that might want it. The
orioles were among the birds that went there; they
preferred graham or entire wheat bread to white bread.</p>
<p>Other birds that came to my yard were the brown
thrasher, the goldfinch, and the redheaded woodpecker.
They had their nests along the ravine.</p>
<p>The redheaded woodpeckers&rsquo; home was in a hole
of an old tree near the ravine. Their call was a
guttural &ldquo;Chr-r-r,&rdquo; which was pleasant to hear. Near
the nest tree was a big stone which they used as a
convenient perch. The woodpecker babies did not
have the showy red head and neck of the parents;
theirs were of a rusty color, and the white on their
wings was barred with black. During the summer,
Father Woodpecker often brought the babies to the
food station. They could help themselves pretty well
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
to suet; but the peanuts were a puzzle to them.
They just pecked into the shell and tried to eat that.
Usually, before the babies arrived, the father came
and perched on some high point and looked all
around. If all was to his liking, he sounded his
rattling tattoo. The babies always came so promptly
that it was evident he had hidden them somewhere
near, probably with orders to await his signal before
venturing farther.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/p2074.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="640" />
<p class="pcap">NEAR THE NEST TREE WAS A BIG STONE WHICH THE
REDHEADED WOODPECKER USED AS A PERCH</p>
</div>
<p>I think the brown thrasher must have had a large
family; he used to tear off pieces of bread and carry
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
them away from the bird table. Once he carried off
a piece of cheese that kept him trailing near the
ground, it was so heavy. A blackbird followed and
tried to take it, but the thrasher got away from him.</p>
<p>A queer thing about the brown thrasher is his song.
It is made up of real words and sentences, and he
sings everything twice or more times. If you should
ever hear a big brown bird, with a long reddish tail
and speckled breast, sing, &ldquo;Beverly Beverly,&rdquo; &ldquo;Peter
Peter,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell it to me! Tell it to me!&rdquo; &ldquo;Come
here! Come here!&rdquo; and such things, then you have
heard the brown thrasher. If you will look high
enough you can almost surely see him too, in the
top of a high tree. He loves to be seen as well as
heard.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown Thrasher looked just like her mate.
She had hidden her nest so well that I did not find
it until it was empty. It was in a dense thicket.
I knew it was hers because she was still near. &ldquo;Io-it!
io-it!&rdquo; she scolded, until I went away. One little
baby thrasher was on a branch of the thicket. The
mother was guarding him.</p>
<p>The goldfinches were very late with their housekeeping.
In July they were still gathering strings
and cotton for their nesting. They are just as polite
and gentle as the chickadees. Their name fits so
well that anybody who sees these yellow birds, just
like canaries with black wings and tail, ought to
know them at once. Their song usually starts with
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
&ldquo;Sweet sweet sweet,&rdquo; and the rest is a regular canary
song. They are sometimes called wild canaries.</p>

<img src="images/p2076.jpg" alt="" width="718" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">EACH LITTLE GOLDFINCH CALLED AS LOUD AS HE COULD</p>
</div>
<p>The young goldfinches loved to sit on the edge of
their nest as soon as they were old enough. As they
sat there they chattered to each other, &ldquo;Ze bebe,
ze bebe,&rdquo; and fluttered their wings a great deal.
When I found their nest I was surprised that I
hadn&rsquo;t seen it before; it was low on a buckeye.</p>
<p>When the young goldfinches left their nest it
seemed as if they wanted to get acquainted with
people. They came down on the lowest branches,
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
and quite near the house. One alighted on the
clothesline. Whenever Father or Mother came with
food there was the greatest fluttering of wings.
Each one called, &ldquo;Ze bebe ze bebe,&rdquo; as loud as he
could, and opened wide his bill to catch what the
parents tossed or squirted out to him. It was no
living, squirming thing, but a pulpy mass.</p>
<p>The young were yellow in front, olive on the back,
and they had black wings with brown and white
bars. The black tail was edged with white.</p>
<p>Goldfinches like sunflower seeds. But the main
reason why they are so useful and so well liked is
that they eat large quantities of thistle seeds and
dandelion seeds.</p>
<p>When cold weather came the parent goldfinches
were no longer so beautifully yellow, for they had put
on their gray autumn coats.</p>

<p class="pcap">THIS MARTIN SCOUT BROUGHT A LADY WITH HIM</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">IX</span>
<br />THE MARTINS&rsquo; AIRCASTLE</h2>
<p>The purple martins like a house with many rooms,
so they can live together in a large company. Since
the martins belong to the swallow family, to call
them purple swallows would, it seems to me, be more
informing.</p>
<p>My friend who had sent me the wren apartment
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
house was so pleased with its success that he sent
me also a martin house. It is four stories high
and has twenty-six rooms. Around each story are
porches, some of them several inches wide.</p>
<p>It pleases birds to have their houses look, before
they occupy them, as if they had been out in all
sorts of weather. So, for several weeks before this
martin house was set up, it lay out in the yard to
be rained and snowed on.</p>
<p>One cold March day a purple bird came in at my
window. He perched on picture frames, twittered a
little, and went out again. According to the bird
books, my little visitor was a purple martin. Maybe
he had seen the martin house on the lawn, and came
to ask me to put it up. Anyway, the next day it
was mounted in the farthest corner of the garden.
For, according to the directions that came with the
house, martins want their houses to be fifty feet away
from any building or tree, and on a pole at least
sixteen feet high.</p>
<p>In early April another martin came; or maybe it
was the same one, returning to see whether the house
had been put up. Martins always send one of their
number ahead to look up a house for them. He is
called a scout. This martin scout perched on the
wires nearby, and tried repeatedly to alight on one
of the porches of the martin house. But some
English sparrows were there; they also wanted that
house. Every time the scout went near, these
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
sparrows flew at him and kept him from getting a
foothold on the house. Sometimes he managed to
perch on the roof and there wait for a chance to
get inside. But the sparrows were too many for
him. Now and then he gave a sad note, as if he
were discouraged and calling for help. Then again
it seemed as if something had encouraged him, and
he sang out clearly something like this:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Whew whew whew <sub class="l1">tr-r-r-r</sub> <sub class="l2">cho cho cho cho.&rdquo;</sub></p>
<p>After holding out against the sparrows for three
days, he went away. About a week later I heard a
sweet and happy twitter. Several martins were
flying around the house. I had named it The
Martins&rsquo; Aircastle. By this time the English sparrows
had begun nesting in some of the rooms.</p>
<p>The martins perched on the wires in front of the
house and made a saucy chatter, calling the sparrows
all sorts of names, I suppose. The sparrows jabbered
back at them. In about an hour the martins left.</p>
<p>Early the next morning another flock of martins
came. Some perched on the wires, some on the roof,
and some on the porches of the martin house. Others
flew around in big circles. All were twittering and
calling in their happiest manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<div class="img" id="fig39">
<img src="images/p2081.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="890" />
<p class="pcap">THE MARTINS&rsquo; AIRCASTLE</p>
</div>
<p>I had driven the sparrows away the night before,
and this is how I did it: I put a few big nails into
a tin can, then closed the can and tied it to a long
stick. With this stick I banged the can against the
martin house pole again and again. It frightened
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
the sleeping sparrows. By the moonlight I could
see six come out and fly away; but I think there were
more.</p>
<p>Two pairs of sparrows came back in the morning.
They had made their nests side by side in the third
story. Long grasses were hanging out from the entrances.
Perhaps the martins were sorry for them;
anyway, it looked as if they were willing to play
fair. They did not chase them off any more; and
the sparrows, being now so few, no longer molested
the martins.</p>
<p>The martins now began to clean house. There
were wads of chicken feathers and some broken eggs
among the rubbish which they threw out. This was
soon replaced by straws and sticks which they
brought for their own nesting. I could only count
twelve pairs of martins, so that there were plenty of
rooms for them and the sparrows too. I suppose
one reason why the sparrows were unwelcome is
because they are such untidy housekeepers as to
render close neighboring with them insanitary.</p>
<p>The more I see of martins, the better I like them.
They are always cheerful, always busy. Their shiny,
purple plumage, broad shoulders, and tapering body
give them a distinguished air. These purple birds
are the father martins. The mother martins&rsquo; back
feathers, when exposed to the sunlight, have all the
shades of violet. In front they are cream-colored, and
finely speckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>These violet-colored ones stayed around home
more than the others; this is why I took them to be
the mothers. The father martins flew around and
brought in the provisions, which they caught on
the wing. On returning a martin would sometimes
sit on the porch and sing into the room to his
mate; or she would come out to him, and the two
would coo to each other in the most affectionate
manner.</p>
<p>The martins were also friendly with all their bird
neighbors. But they were so high up that their
housekeeping was for the most part a secret which
they wanted to keep to themselves. It was hard to
tell what they had to eat, except when one caught
a dragonfly or a grasshopper. When one got a big
catch like that, he usually held it squirming in his
bill a while as if he was proud of it and wanted to
show it off. Or maybe he tried in this way to prolong
the enjoyment of it. When it began to disappear
in his bill the body always went first and the
wings last.</p>
<p>Martins are not strong on their feet. Even when
walking around on the porches of their house they
just waddled, like ducks. But at flying they are
masters. They can soar high, almost out of sight,
then shoot straight down and skim along close to the
ground.</p>
<p>Sometimes the martins visited the basin to get a
drink or to bathe. One of their favorite pastimes
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
was to roll in the sand in our garden. When around
home they loved to perch on the wires or lounge on
the porches. They also visited a bald tree not far
off, and there preened themselves. I never saw them
visit trees that had foliage on them.</p>
<p>Some more English sparrows tried from time to
time to come back. It seemed as if they watched
for the martins to go away. Then they would come
and peer into the rooms, and even go in. The martins,
however, always left one of their number on
guard, for usually the intruders were soon chased
away.</p>
<p>Once a martin caught an English sparrow in his
room. He went in, but kept one wing outside, and
that wing flapped and fluttered just like a flag in a
high wind. No doubt the sparrow got a good beating
with the other wing. Sounds of &ldquo;Kr-r-r! kr-r-r!&rdquo;
came from the room. &ldquo;Kr-r-r!&rdquo; is the scolding
word of the martins. It sounds as if someone,
walking beside a picket fence, were scraping it with a
stick. I have often heard the martins say it to the
sparrows, but never have I heard them use it among
themselves. They are the most contented birds,
always polite and kind to one another. For good
behavior I have put them on the honor roll with the
chickadees and the goldfinches.</p>
<p>The martins are also wonderful singers and
whistlers. They sing all day long, and often after
dark. Their song is made up of three parts: a
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
sibilant or smacking twitter, a trill, and a whistle.
To me it sounds something like this:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Hee<sub class="l1">\chut-chut-chut</sub>/<sup class="l1">tr-r-r-r</sup>\<sub class="l1">ho</sub>/<sup class="l1">hee</sup>\ho-ho-ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They keep this up in a sort of conversational fashion,
and as they do so are continually changing places on
the housetop, the porches, or the wires.</p>
<p>In June the baby martins began to lounge on the
porches and to sun themselves on the wires. After
a while there were more babies. The porches were
covered with them. My! how busy those parents
were! As babies increased in numbers, evidently the
parents felt that the older ones ought to become
self-supporting; but they preferred to spend their
days preening and twittering and being waited on.
The parents pecked and scolded them, and finally
pushed them off their perches to make them go and
hunt food for themselves.</p>
<p>One day after the second batch of babies had appeared
outside, two hawks came and perched on the
telephone wires near the martin home. My attention
was attracted to them by the guttural calls or scoldings
of the martins. As they called, they flew swiftly
to and from the house, and around in big circles.
Soon the wires were lined with martins that had come
from other colonies, and the air was rent with their
guttural shriekings. Evidently they felt that these
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
big birds were a great menace to their young. To
the credit of the English sparrows it must be said
that they also flew around with the martins, and
tried to help them call attention to the danger. The
hawks stayed about fifteen minutes, looking constantly
in all directions; for they were completely
surrounded by the vigilant and frantic martins all
that time. Then they flew into a bald tree near by,
and after looking on from there a while they flew
away. They returned a few times after that, but
never again stayed long enough to cause such a
commotion.</p>
<p>After the young were all able to fly, the whole
company was usually away most of the day. Early
in the morning when they were getting ready to go,
and at sunset time when they returned, there was
always a great demonstration, with trilling, and
twittering, and whistling, about the house and on the
wires. The home-coming of the martins was a daily
event to which not only we, but our neighbors also,
looked forward.</p>
<p>Then, as night set in, there was a steady chorus of
cooing as if each martin mother were singing a lullaby
to her numerous babies. We used to wonder how
they all existed in those rooms, six inches square by
six inches high. For no matter how hot the night,
they all went inside before midnight.</p>
<p>One evening my former neighbor, Mrs. Daily, was
present when the martins returned. She also had
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
put up a martin house, but so far it had not been
occupied.</p>

<br />THE HOME-COMING OF THE MARTINS</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your house has such wide porches, and mine
hasn&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; she remarked, as she watched the returning
birds sit on the porches and coo to each
other. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I have been told that
my house is too near the garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that martins are not easily attracted;
but when once they have accepted a house they will
be steady summer tenants for years. When I think
what a pleasure it is to have a flock of these lovely
birds, year after year, from April to September, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
wonder that any good-sized yard is without a martin
house. Martins are content to live anywhere, in
town or country. All they want is the right kind of
a house with plenty of room around it, and they like
some wires near by for perches.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a martin house, perched high
in broad sunlight, needs ventilation. But this must be
provided without causing drafts. It can be provided
by making a half-inch horizontal slit on the inner
walls just below the ceiling, something like the
ventilation in a steamer cabin. Martins will not
tolerate drafts. Then if the two topmost rooms in
the martin house are made to connect by means of a
hole two and a half inches in diameter, next to the
ceiling, this will greatly assist the visiting scout.
When English sparrows see the scout enter the house,
they will lie in wait where he entered, expecting to
molest him when he comes out. But if he can leave
at another exit and get his colony while the sparrows
still wait for him, they will have to surrender when
he returns. It is a question of numbers. This kind
of house, even though it have only six or eight rooms,
will attract martins, and promise a good beginning in
martin lore.</p>
<p>My neighbor, Mrs. Cotton, has now a martin house
also. It has ten rooms, ventilated as described above
and with the two upper rooms connecting. There being
no telephone wires near enough, a wire running over
the house on four uprights serves the same purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The first martin that was seen to visit this house
brought a lady martin with him. Maybe he had
been there before, alone, without being noticed. The
pair inspected the rooms, then perched on the wire
overhead and preened. Every little while Mr.
Martin twittered:</p>
<p class="center"><sup class="l2">&ldquo;Chow chow chow</sup> <sup class="l1">choo</sup>choo<sub class="l1">choo</sub><sub class="l2">ho/</sub><sub class="l1">/</sub>/<sup class="l1">/hee</sup>ho<sub class="l1">ho</sub><sub class="l2">ho&rdquo;</sub></p>
<p>and</p>
<p class="center"><sup class="l2">&ldquo;Yo</sup> <sup class="l1">yo</sup> yo <sub class="l1">yo</sub> <sub class="l2">yo.&rdquo;</sub></p>
<p>This pair took possession of the upper east room.
The next day four more martins came. One pair
took a lower east room, the other took the south
room. It looked as though the wire on top and the
ventilation pleased them. I was overjoyed that this
house, which I had designed, proved satisfactory to
these notional birds.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the rooms in this house are six
inches square by seven inches high. The diameter of
the entrances is two and a half inches; the width of
porch five inches. The pole extends through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
center of the house and is screwed to the roof. The
rest of this house is held in place by means of a bolt
underneath, which can be taken out and the house&mdash;without
its roof&mdash;let down to be cleaned.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Now listen to the good that martins do: A martin
will eat mosquitoes by the thousand every day, besides
many insects that injure fruit trees and spoil
the fruit. To protect their young, martins will drive
away hawks and other big birds that come near. In
this way they also protect any poultry yard near by.
On moonlight nights they hunt the moths and millers
until midnight.</p>
<p>In late August the martins began to assemble in
ever increasing numbers, getting ready for the journey
to their winter home, which is said to be in Central
and South America.</p>
<p>During one of the days while those gatherings were
going on, the boy was here. The martins had, by this
time, become so confiding that we could go clear up
to the pole on which their house was mounted,&mdash;and
they would stay on the wires and look down at us!
I told the boy how I had driven the sparrows away
from the martin house, and showed him the stick with
the can tied to it. He tried it on the nearest telephone
pole, and instantly the martins flew from
the wires. It looked like a great gathering in midair.</p>
<p>The father martins were much darker at this time
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
than in the Spring,&mdash;in fact, almost black. Mother&rsquo;s
pretty violet hues had faded to gray. Baby Martin
was brownish-gray on the back, and light in front.</p>
<p>One day the whole colony departed, a jolly company,
leaving us sad indeed, but hopeful that they would
return with the Spring flowers.</p>

<p class="pcap">A BATH FOR BIRDS AND A LUNCH BESIDE IT</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">X</span>
<br />MORE ABOUT THE BOY</h2>
<p>I am sure that the farm at the end of our street is
like home to the birds of the neighborhood, and that
that good boy is big brother to them all. He always
has a bath for the birds set out on a table, and a
lunch beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be surprised to see how well the birds
like oatmeal mush and other cereals,&rdquo; said he, the
last time I was there. &ldquo;Just watch that song sparrow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>The little brown bird was feeding on a shredded
wheat biscuit. She stayed long enough to eat a
hearty meal; then took away as much as she could
carry in her bill. While I sat there she returned
several times for more.</p>
<p>We were out in the boy&rsquo;s workshop. He had just
finished making what he called a food house. It was
a tray roofed over, &ldquo;to keep out the rain and snow,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>I remarked that it was early (it was in July) to
talk about snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is one of my vacation jobs.
After school begins I won&rsquo;t have time for these things.
I&rsquo;ll be a freshman in High, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tray was about a foot long and not quite so
wide. On each side there was a wire pocket to hold
suet. Four neat, round sticks supported the roof,
which he said was made out of the sides of a soap
box.</p>
<p>I asked where he got those fine round sticks and
that pretty tray. He said the sticks were scraps
from his uncle&rsquo;s cabinet shop, and that he got the
tray from the grocer. The name &ldquo;Neufch&acirc;tel&rdquo; was
printed on the sides of the tray in big letters.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if all the Neufch&acirc;tel
cheese boxes were made into food trays for birds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I know that our grocer
would rather give his boxes away for some useful
purpose than to burn them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>I admired the little food house so much that the
boy gave me some sticks so that I could make one,
too.</p>
<p>Then he told me of a pair of cedar waxwings that
had nested in the orchard, and a pair of crested
flycatchers in a woodpecker&rsquo;s house. I was very
curious to see the waxwings, so we went to them first.
The nest was about ten feet up in an apple tree.
With our field glasses we could see it quite plainly
from under the nearest tree. Mrs. Waxwing was
sitting up there; we could just see her head and her
tail. Mr. Waxwing visited her every few minutes
with some food. They were the quietest birds I
have ever seen. What they did say or sing was in
very soft tones, as if they were telling each other
secrets. I hummed parts of the little song occasionally.
When I explained to the boy why I did so,
he smiled, and looked as if he didn&rsquo;t quite believe
me.</p>
<p>We went from the waxwings to the flycatchers.
They lived in what the boy called a Berlepsch house.
That means it was designed by a man named Berlepsch
who was a great friend of birds. The boy
said his uncle in New York had sent him the house
as a birthday present. What could be a nicer gift
for a boy than a bird house? It would make him
want to get birds in it, of course. And I can think
of nothing that would make a boy happier than to
have bird neighbors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/p2095.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="764" />
<p class="pcap">THE CRESTED FLYCATCHER AND A BERLEPSCH HOUSE</p>
</div>
<p>The Berlepsch house was made so one could raise
the top, lid-fashion, and clean it when necessary. It
was mounted about twelve feet high on a brook
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
willow that stood aslant in the ravine; and it had
been intended for woodpeckers. The crested flycatchers
are brown birds with gray upper breast and
yellow below. Their headfeathers are always ruffed,
which gives the appearance of a crest.</p>
<p>The flycatchers were flying back and forth continually
with all sorts of prey. The brown bugs called
&ldquo;Canadian soldiers&rdquo; were numerous that day and were
easy to catch. These parent birds evidently had a
large family, judging from the amount of food they
delivered.</p>
<p>Mr. Flycatcher had a loud, explosive whistle. It
sounded as if he were saying:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Wha-<sup class="l1">a-</sup><sup class="l2">at?&rdquo;</sup></p>
<p>The young could be heard giving the same whistle,
but much more softly, and somewhat long drawn
out:</p>
<p class="center"><sub class="l1">&ldquo;Wha-</sub>a-<sup class="l1">a-</sup><sup class="l2">at?&rdquo;</sup></p>
<p>After our visit with the flycatchers we returned to
the waxwings. Waxwings are brown and about the
size of bluebirds. On the back of the head they have
a tuft. A black line extends across the bill, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
around the side of the head. The front is yellowish-gray
and the tail edged with yellow. The name,
waxwing, is due to a shiny red patch on their
wings. The fact that these waxwings are very fond
of cedar berries must be what has given them also
the name of cedar bird. The nest was made of twigs,
strings, and various kinds of fiber. The boy said
that a few weeks ago he had cut his dog&rsquo;s hair and
left it lying on the lawn: that these waxwings then
came and carried every bit of it to their nest.</p>
<p>While near the birds I hummed the bird song
again, to let them know that the same persons were
there that had visited them before. The mother
bird was looking straight at us and sitting perfectly
still all the while. The boy said he believed the song
did help to keep her quiet.</p>
<p>On a cornice of the front porch a ph&oelig;be had made
two nests, one last year and one this. Both nests
were now empty. I said I hoped that a ph&oelig;be
would come to live on our porch next year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have this one,&rdquo; answered the boy; and
added, &ldquo;I have to wash off the porch every day
while Ph&oelig;be is nesting: she scatters so much
mud.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/p2098.jpg" alt="" width="868" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">KITTY WATCHING FOR MICE</p>
</div>
<p>As for me, I would gladly clean off our porch
several times a day if a ph&oelig;be would nest here and
sing as sweetly, &ldquo;Ph&oelig;be, ph&oelig;be,&rdquo; as I heard that
one sing. Sometimes I noticed a slight trill in the
second syllable of her song, like &ldquo;Ph&oelig;bery.&rdquo; She
sang &ldquo;Ph&oelig;be&rdquo; with the inflection generally downward;
but when she trilled it, &ldquo;Ph&oelig;bery,&rdquo; the inflection
was always upwards:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Ph&oelig;-<sup class="l1">be-</sup><sup class="l2">ry.&rdquo;</sup></p>
<p class="center"><sup class="l1">&ldquo;Pee-</sup>e- <sub class="l1">a-</sub> <sub class="l2">wee-</sub> <sub class="l1">e-</sub> e- <sup class="l1">e-</sup> <sup class="l2"> ee&rdquo;</sup></p>
<p>came up from the ravine, clear as a strain from a
flute. On my way home I saw the pewee on a fence
picket. Every little while he flew after an insect,
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
then back to a picket. As I walked slowly along,
he flew from picket to picket ahead of me, until I
came to where the houses on the street begin again.
Then he flew back. I think that pewee and ph&oelig;be
must be some relation, they look so nearly alike.
And both sing their own names.</p>
<p>Another bird who sings his name is Bob White,
the quail. &ldquo;Bob <i>White</i>!&rdquo; came ringing across the
meadow every little while. The boy could whistle it
exactly the same as the bird, and they answered each
other back and forth. Bob White was on a fence
post,&mdash;a large brown bird with a stubby tail.</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving Day I was up at the farm again,
and I saw a shelter which the boy had made for the
winter comfort of Bob White, and other birds who
wished to share it. It was tent-like, made out of
cornstalks, the inside filled with pea vines, bean vines,
morning-glory vines, and several sheaves of oats.
Kitty was watching beside the shelter,&mdash;for mice,
the boy explained!</p>
<p>The new food house was being visited by bluejays,
who nibbled at the suet. A smaller feedery on a tree
had corn in a tray and suet in a wire pocket. This
feedery was much liked by downies, and small gray
birds with white on lower front and tail&mdash;juncos.
Juncos came in flocks of a dozen or more, and twittered,
&ldquo;Tut, tut, tut,&rdquo; to each other and to us, in
sociable fashion. They preferred to pick up the scatterings
of chickfeed on the ground, rather than perch
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
on the tray. Both of these food stations were protected
with tin sheeting to keep the squirrel from eating
the birds&rsquo; food. This visit at the boy&rsquo;s home made
me wish more than ever that some day I, too, might
live on a farm.</p>

<p>On that Thanksgiving Day I had quite a surprise.
Some dogs came barking from the ravine. Before
them ran a rabbit just as fast as he could. They
were the dogs that had so often chased Bunny, and
this rabbit looked so much like Bunny, that I felt
sure it was he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my rabbit,&rdquo; said the boy, as he went to
chase the dogs away. I was glad to know that
Bunny had such a nice home, and that the boy was
a big brother to him also.</p>

<p class="pcap">A TREE TRIMMED WITH PEANUTS FOR THE BIRDS</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">XI</span>
<br />THE CARDINALS</h2>
<p>Having often seen cardinals feed in poultry yards
with chickens, I again started to scatter chickfeed,
hoping to attract those beautiful birds to my house.
<i>Chickfeed</i> is finer than <i>chickenfeed</i>, and I believe the
birds like it better.</p>
<p>Every winter I trimmed up an old tree with peanuts
for the birds&rsquo; Christmas, and always after a snowstorm
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
I tramped the snow down; then scattered the
feed on it, with buckwheat and sunflower seeds added.</p>
<p>At first only nuthatches, chickadees, and juncos
came to my lunches on the snow. One stormy day
a cardinal ventured into our front yard; but he did
not go near the chickfeed. Several juncos were there,
and maybe he wanted to be generous and leave it all
to the smaller birds.</p>
<p>He kept coming nearer to the house. At last he
flew pell-mell into our porch. It seemed as if the
wind had blown him in. On a little shelf behind the
windshield he alighted and stayed.</p>
<p>After a while another bird flew to the little shelf.
I hadn&rsquo;t noticed this bird before, my attention being
taken up with the cardinal. This second bird was
reddish green. In my little bird guide I had seen
pictures of the two cardinals, so I knew that she was
the red one&rsquo;s mate.</p>
<p>The cardinal pecked at her when she went to his
side, and the meek little bird just clung to the shelf.
The next day I made a shelf for her just below his.</p>
<p>At dusk the cardinals returned, silently, even
stealthily, as though they thought it unwise to publish
their presence. Again he was a little ahead of
her, and he flew to the new shelf. She alighted on
the edge of the upper one. After a while she tripped
a little farther in, to a more comfortable place. When
she was settled, he went to her shelf and snuggled
down beside her. Maybe he was sorry that he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
acted so selfishly the day before. I never saw him
peck at her again.</p>
<p>Every stormy day that winter the cardinals came
to our porch at evening. They became so confiding
after a week or so that he usually announced their
arrival with a few low hissing notes, something like
&ldquo;Tset, tset, tset!&rdquo; Sometimes he would perch on
the upper shelf, sometimes on the lower. Mrs.
Cardinal was a peace-loving bird. She always came
last, and took the empty shelf. Usually he would
change so as to sit beside her. They were always
gone in the morning, no matter how early I came out;
and when they came in the evening it was usually
dusk. So I never got a picture of my cardinals on
the shelves.</p>
<p>Mr. Cardinal finally got so he sometimes came to the
lunch on the snow; but his favorite feedery was a
tray in my neighbor&rsquo;s yard, which I kept supplied
with shelled peanuts and shelled corn. The English
sparrows could not manage these large kernels, so
the cardinals had this feedery to themselves. This
may be the reason why they preferred it to the one
on the ground.</p>
<p>But the cardinals must have procured much of
their food elsewhere, for they came only about once
in three or four hours to get a dainty at the tray.
Strange to say they never came together. Always
he came first and ate a while, then sometimes she
would come, too. It seemed as if she let him come
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
first, then, seeing that he stayed, she took it for
granted that all was well.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig48">
<img src="images/p2105.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="601" />
<p class="pcap">THE CARDINAL&rsquo;S FAVORITE FEEDERY</p>
</div>
<p>In March the cardinals stopped sleeping on the
porch. About that time I began to hear almost
daily a new song. It sounded like,</p>
<p class="center"><sup class="l1">&ldquo;D</sup> e <sub class="l1">a</sub> <sub class="l2">r gilly gilly gilly gilly!&rdquo;</sub></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Immediately after it there would be a loose twitter:
&ldquo;Chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk,&rdquo;&mdash;so soft and low, it
seemed it must be very near. Usually it brought
another song from the cardinal, and presently he
would appear with a morsel for Mrs. Cardinal, who
had a favorite perch in our little pear tree. I soon
learned that the twitter was her response to his call.
The winsome sight of seeing him feed her repaid me
for all the money I spent for peanuts at thirteen
cents the pound.</p>
<p>The pair began now to frequent the ravine more
than usual. On its edge lay a log from which the
outer bark had been removed. Here the cardinals
were often to be seen, peeling and tearing off strips
of wood-fiber, which they bore away in long flowing
streamers.</p>
<p>One morning Mrs. Cotton came in. &ldquo;Here is news
for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The red bird and a greenish
bird are making a nest in my syringa bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The birds went on with their nesting for several
days. Then Mrs. Cotton came over again, looking
sad. The birds were carrying away all their nesting
material, she said. They had probably seen the cat,
had become alarmed for the safety of their home, and
so changed its location.</p>
<p>The cardinal had several songs. One was:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;Whit whit <sup class="l2">d</sup> <sup class="l1">e</sup> a <sub class="l1">r</sub> <sup class="l2">d</sup> <sup class="l1">e</sup> a <sub class="l1">r</sub> <sup class="l2">whoit whoit whoit&rdquo;</sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>

<p class="center"><sub class="l2">&ldquo;W</sub> <sub class="l1">h</sub> o <sup class="l1">i</sup> <sup class="l2">t</sup> <sub class="l2">w</sub> <sub class="l1">h</sub> o <sup class="l1">i</sup> <sup class="l2">t&rdquo;</sup></p>
<p>sung from three to ten times in succession. Sometimes, when
Mrs. Cardinal did not respond promptly, he &ldquo;chuk&rdquo;-ed,
himself, in imitation of her notes.</p>
<p>In late August I found the cardinals&rsquo; deserted nest
in an evergreen on the ravine&rsquo;s edge. It was made
almost entirely of this stringy wood-fiber, lined with
fine rootlets, and interwoven with many leaves.</p>
<p>I never saw but two baby cardinals of this brood.
They were brownish birds, and they had the red bill
of the parents.</p>
<p>After August I saw nothing more of their mother.
I have suspected that a boy down the street was to
blame; his favorite plaything was an air-gun, and
he had been caught shooting a brown thrasher shortly
before. It seems to me the laws protecting song-birds
ought to be taught in every school, and that
children should be obliged to know that shooting
song-birds or their young, or spoiling or stealing their
eggs or nest, is a crime punishable by fine or imprisonment,
or both.</p>
<p>Father Cardinal was seen tending the young
faithfully until October. Then he suddenly turned
on them. Whenever they followed him after that he
drove them from him. The young found peanuts
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
which I had chopped and scattered on the ground for
them. But whenever Father found the young birds
eating these nuts, he chased them away. Once a
baby cardinal found a whole peanut. He bravely
ventured to eat it, and in the attempt got the shell
partly open. He was just picking a nut out, when
his brother tried to snatch it from him. A struggle
followed, during which the shell broke in two, and
each contestant got a kernel. In November the
young cardinals disappeared.</p>
<p>Father Cardinal&rsquo;s persecution of his motherless
children seemed unnatural, not to say cruel. Can it
be that he tried thus to compel his young to seek
their natural food, rather than to subsist on dainties
furnished? Did he want to encourage them to become
self-reliant and useful? Only on this theory
can I account for his conduct.</p>
<p>Our cardinal was a widower for some weeks
longer. Only a few times during that mild winter
did he come to sleep on our porch, and on those
occasions he came alone. Then a lady cardinal appeared,
and she followed him persistently. But he
wholly ignored her. Finally she began to carry food
to him and to feed him. Whether this be a last resort
of wooing in birddom, or not, I do not know.
Anyhow, Mr. Cardinal relented. The next thing, he
was seen to feed her whom he had treated so coolly.
This was a pretty sure sign that the two had come
to an understanding. Again the old log by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
ravine was being visited for nesting material. Again
all his songs rang out, and he added a new one. It
seemed as if he were singing over and over:</p>

<br />MY BIRD FAMILY</h2>
<p>A great big family&mdash;that&rsquo;s what my bird neighbors
are to me. This large family is made up of
smaller families. Let me set them all down in a row:
There are the bluebirds, meadowlarks, killdeers, song
sparrows, robins, purple martins, goldfinches, wrens,
orioles, thrashers, thrushes, waxwings, flycatchers,
pewee, ph&oelig;be, and the redheaded woodpecker. Oh,
there is one more. I would by no means slight the
humble chimney swift. When I hear that &ldquo;Gitse
gitse&rdquo; twitter, then I know that they, too, have come.
From early March when the first bluebird arrives,
until late May when pewee comes, I am like a mother
who waits at evening, unsatisfied until all her children
are in for the night. When I hear the call of
the latest comer, the sweet-voiced pewee, then I
know that my absent ones have all returned.</p>
<p>Add to these the Bob Whites, the cardinals, bluejays,
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
and flickers, who stay the year round, and the
chickadees, nuthatches, downy and hairy woodpeckers,
and juncos, who come in autumn to spend the winter,
and you have my bird family, a wonderful family,
of musicians, of workmen, of homemakers&mdash;fathers
and mothers and children.</p>
<p>To me the ways of birds are more entertaining than
the best play I have ever attended. They enact real
life, not make-believes. Then, too, what music can
be compared to the sunrise and sunset concerts of
birds in springtime and in early summer? To know
each singer by name adds much to the enjoyment.</p>
<p>The ways of birds are also wonderful, past finding
out. Who can explain how they make their nests
so pretty, when the only tools they have are beak
and feet? Then, how gingerly they hide their nests,
some with dainty curtains of leaves, others by blending
colors! To find a bird&rsquo;s nest always fills me with
reverence. It is a little home, a sacred place to its
owners. It shall be sacred to me. The mother-wit
and father-wisdom that birds show in rearing their
young and in protecting them from harm makes me
believe that they do think and plan and reason out
things much as we human beings do. The most
wonderful thing about birds is the long journey that
so many of them make every year, generally with
several babies only a few months old in the family.</p>
<p>It has been proved that birds will return year after
year to the same orchard, garden, yard, or porch. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
know my birds by their actions. I do not need to tie
bands on their legs to know them. When they return
they visit all their familiar haunts, not cautiously as
a stranger would, but boldly, and with the joyousness
of those who have returned home after a long absence.
They call to me as if they would say: &ldquo;Here we
are again! Are you still here, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then what curiosity they display when they find
a new bath! How they fly over and around it, trying
to satisfy themselves that it is a safe place to
alight! What joy they express by their splashing!</p>
<p>It was while taking her bath that Mother Oriole
was caught one day by the camera. Most wonderful
to tell, her own babies whom she often brought with
her took this picture. How did they do it? They
tried to perch on the thread leading from the camera
over to the house, where I sat waiting for Mrs.
Oriole to come out of the water before taking her
picture. The thread was not strong enough to hold
the young birds. They went down with it, and in so
doing snapped the spring which operated the shutter.
This took the picture of Mother Oriole in the bath.</p>
<p>Those of my bird family who inhabit houses are
sure every spring to find either some new houses, or
their old ones cleaned and repaired.</p>
<p>I always keep two houses up for bluebirds, and
several for wrens. It is pleasant to watch them make
their choice, and after a fledging they can set up
housekeeping again in the same house, or take
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
another. My experience has been that birds become
attached to a house where they have safely fledged
a brood, and if it is promptly cleaned they will return
to it, rather than try a new one. But I have
known instances where a pair began a second nesting
before the young of their first brood were fledged.
In such a case an extra house is convenient.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig51">
<img src="images/p2113.jpg" alt="" width="870" height="600" />
<p class="pcap">MOTHER ORIOLE IN THE BATH</p>
</div>
<p>My bluebird house is five by seven inches,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> and is
so shaped as to afford depth. Sufficient height is
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
secured by means of a gable roof; and a half-inch
hole immediately under the roof affords ventilation.</p>
<p>The bluebird covers the floor of her house with
grasses to the depth of about an inch and a half.
Away back against the rear wall she makes the little
hollow in which she lays her eggs. I make her entrance
one inch and a half in diameter, and just
below the middle front. While brooding she can
look outside, and this affords her some diversion
during that monotonous task. This certainly seemed
to be what one bluebird aimed at who nested in
Mrs. Daily&rsquo;s wren house. The wad of grasses in
that house reached clear up to the entrance, which
was about four inches above the floor. Apparently
this bird had tried to build her nest high enough so
she could look outside.</p>
<p>Wrens always make a litter several inches high of
twigs and other materials. In this litter they embed
their nest of fine grasses and feathers. Hence I conclude
that they want their entrance several inches
above the floor, so that, on going in, they can walk
over the litter and do not have to grope through it.
Being small birds they need only a small house.
After years of experimenting I have settled on five
inches by seven for wrens also, but their house is so
shaped as to afford height. The sides run up at the
back to twelve inches. A half-inch hole high on
each side affords ventilation. I make the entrance
one inch and an eighth in diameter, just too small
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
for the English sparrow, but large enough to serve
some other small bird should no wrens come. A
smaller entrance makes it difficult for wrens to get
in their bulky nesting materials. My wrens raised
three broods in their little house in the pear tree last
summer.</p>
<p>A friend of mine bought a wren house which has
a low entrance. Some wrens nested in it. One day
Father Wren was very much excited, but no one could
understand what was the trouble. The next day,
believing that the wrens had fledged their young, my
friend ordered the house to be cleaned. To her
horror she found Mother Wren wedged in among the
nesting, dead. The babies were dead in their nest.
Evidently their increasing weight had settled the
nesting materials so the mother could not get out any
more and neither could Father Wren go in. Let this
be a warning to all who make wren houses, to make
the entrance several inches above the floor!</p>
<p>My houses for wrens and bluebirds are so made
that they can be easily opened after use, and cleaned.
The front on the wren house can be raised, that on
the bluebird house lowered. By means of a screw
eye, the front is securely closed while the house is in
use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>

<p class="pcap">SO MADE THAT THEY CAN BE EASILY OPENED AFTER USE
AND CLEANED</p>
</div>
<p>Of late I have also used an open shelter. It consists
of a tray about five inches square, roofed over,
and serves two purposes. For winter use I fasten a
small wire pocket on it, into which I put beef suet.
Then I mount this shelter about five feet high on a
tree. Around the trunk I fasten strings of peanuts;
in the tray I keep shelled corn, of which cardinals
are especially fond. The English sparrow does not
care for the suet, and as he cannot manage the corn
nor the peanuts, this feedery attracts only desirable
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
birds. In March I remove the wire pocket, and
mount the shelter a few feet higher, to serve as a
nest shelter for robins. The roof will ward off heavy
rains, which destroy so many robin&rsquo;s nests. A
similar shelter, if fastened in the shade on a wall,
might attract ph&oelig;bes.</p>
<p>When one starts out to make bird houses he should
decide first of all what birds he wishes to attract by
means of them. Booklets containing drawings and
instructions for making houses for many kinds of
house-nesting birds can be had free by addressing a
postcard to the Biological Survey, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Whoever tries to attract birds should also protect
them from storms, from their natural enemies, and
from meddlesome people. Birds will sometimes reject
a good house because it is not properly mounted,
or because the location is objectionable. The boy
and I visited a park lately where about a hundred
bird houses had been put up, and but a few were said
to be occupied. These houses were so constructed
that, by turning a cleat underneath, the floor could
be pulled down and out. If occupied, opening them
in this way might have disturbed the nest. We
visited twenty-five of these houses. All except two
were mounted so low that the boy could reach them,
some with ease, and turn those cleats. Only the two
which he could not reach were occupied.</p>
<p>Some people have recommended tin cans as nest
boxes for small birds. I have tried the tin can, carefully
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
painted and placed in the shade. But, even with
these precautions, I would discourage its use. People
are so apt to forget about placing it in the shade! I
have seen birds&rsquo; nests in tin cans with little skeletons
embedded in them, the birds having been smothered
by the intense heat which metal will store.</p>
<p>Enough wooden boxes are discarded by grocers,
druggists, and other merchants to stock the country
every year with bird houses. If our fathers and
mothers will encourage the making of these discards
into bird houses, shelters,
and feederies, it will
mark a step forward in
bird protection.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig53">

<p class="pcap">FOOD HOUSE, MADE OUT OF
WASTE MATERIALS</p>
</div>
<p>Food houses should be
protected so that other
animals cannot mount
and monopolize them,
keeping the birds at bay.
The red squirrel will do
this unless the food tray
is at least five feet above
ground and the post well
sheathed in tin.</p>
<p>My newest food house
has the lid of a cheese
box as tray and the top
of a sugar barrel as roof.
This flat surface is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
handy place for a basin of water. In each of the four
pillars supporting the roof is a hole, to be stuffed with
suet, cheese, peanut butter, etc. My grocer saves the
drippings from his peanut grinder for my birds, so
there is no extravagance in giving them this dainty.
Song sparrows and bluebirds like it as well as the
woodpeckers. On the side of the tray I tack nesting
material. So this food house, made out of waste
materials, serves several uses. The boy liked it so
well he patterned one after it for his birds.</p>
<p>Every autumn a lisping, whispered, dreamy bird
song coming from some low elevation has puzzled me.
The bird looked like the song sparrow, but this soft
warble was so different from his spirited spring and
summer songs that I could not believe my eyes.
After repeated autumn entries in my notebook, &ldquo;I see
his heavy breastspot heave and swell, and his tail
quiver as the song sparrow&rsquo;s always does when he
sings,&rdquo; I was gratified to find my findings confirmed by
another observer.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> The singer was the song sparrow.</p>
<p>But to return to my bird family.</p>
<p>From the time the first birds arrive in the spring
until they leave again, my notebook and my field
glasses are my constant companions. Now here are
some little nature secrets. My notebook is a green
one. I have to buy the paper in large sheets of the
wholesaler, and make the books myself. A green
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
notebook on my lap does not make such a striking
patch on the landscape as a white one would. The
birds do not notice it so readily. Then, whenever I
am out &ldquo;birding,&rdquo; except in winter, I wear green
clothes. When taking pictures I use green focusing
cloths instead of the usual black ones. These things
are great helps in bird study.</p>
<p>There now! For the first time in this book I have
used the word &ldquo;study&rdquo; in connection with birds.
Some people think they must study volumes on ornithology
before they can enjoy birds. Nothing
could be farther from the truth.</p>
<p>Even the little tot in a family may have an interest
in his bird neighbors that will provide him wholesome
pastime. I know one who, ever since he could
walk well, has faithfully kept the birds&rsquo; bath in the
yard supplied with fresh water, and who saves all the
table scraps for them. He wears an Audubon button
and says he is &ldquo;the birdies&rsquo; policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Love, look, listen, appreciate; let these be your
watchwords. Just love the birds. Look, as long as
they remain in sight. Observe their ways and their
appearance. Listen to their songs. Try to know
your immediate bird neighbors by appearance, name,
and song. Do them a kindness when possible. This
will lead up to recognition of birds, which creates a
desire for study of them. The rest will follow. You
will begin to record observations. You will <i>wish</i> for
field glasses and bird books. You will <i>want</i> to spend
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
your holidays and your vacations where you can see
birds. Before you realize it you will be one of those
happiest of individuals, a nature lover, as all true
bird lovers are. It cannot be otherwise, because the
birds will draw you out to nature at all times, and
make you see her in all her moods.</p>
<p>Then some day, when everybody loves birds,
perhaps they will no longer hide their nests, and
may even fly to us, instead of away from us.</p>

<p>For picture of bluebird house, see <a href="#ncfig1">inside back cover</a>; for picture
of wren house, see <a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>. The sides of both houses are nailed
to the edges of the back in such a way as to let the back project
below, about one inch.</p>
<p>In the bluebird house, the upper edges of the sides should be
beveled to fit the slope of the roof. The front of this house is
hinged upon a one-inch brad driven in, on each side, a half-inch
above the lower corner. To enable the front to swing downward,
as shown on <a href="#Page_116">page 116</a>, the floor must be fastened in place three-fourths
of an inch above the lower edge of the sides. Before
nailing on the roof, see that the front swings easily. Bore half-inch
holes in the projecting back below and above, for wire to run
through to strap the house in place. Add a perch of doweling a
half inch below the entrance. See <a href="#ncfig1">figure on inside back cover</a>.</p>
<p>The wren house is also provided with a swinging front, hinged
like that of the bluebird house, but with the brads placed one inch
from the upper corners so that it opens up instead of down. This
is shown on <a href="#Page_116">page 116</a>. The upper part of the back of wren house
is planed flush with the sloping sides, and the roof is planed flush
with the back. The air holes on each side will also serve for wire
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
to run through. Other holes for this purpose should be bored in
the projecting back at the bottom. Again see figure on <a href="#Page_116">page 116</a>.
Add a perch of doweling a half inch below the entrance.</p>

<p>The holes in the backs should be about an inch apart on the
surface and should be bored at an angle, so as to lead the wire
snugly around the trunk. When the houses are put up for use, the
front of each is securely closed by means of a screw eye on the side,
which can be easily removed for the purpose of cleaning. Bluebird
and wren houses should be in shade or part shade, about ten feet
above ground, and mounted so that the upper part tilts slightly
forward.</p>

<p>In the center of the base a hole 4&Prime;&times;6&Prime; is cut to fit the pole
upon which the house is to be mounted. Two cleats are nailed
underneath the base, crosswise of the boards and plumb with
either side of the 4&Prime;&times;6&Prime; hole. The box for the lower story is
partitioned into nine compartments, each 6&Prime; square and 7&Prime; high.
This gives eight outside rooms and a central space through which
the pole may go. In order to provide ventilation near the ceiling,
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
make the partitions only 6&frac12;&Prime; high. They need not be nailed, but
may be dovetailed, like partitions in an egg box.</p>
<p>To make the house so it can be easily opened, for cleaning or
to rout the English sparrows, fasten the box for lower story in the
center of the base by means of screw eyes and hooks, two on a side.
The projecting part of the base will form a 5&Prime;-wide porch all around,
a convenience which martins greatly enjoy. The ceiling is allowed
to project 2&frac12;&Prime; at the front and back to form porches for the upper
rooms. Add a gable ample enough to afford at each end a room
6&Prime; wide and 7&Prime; high. In the upper end of the partition between
these two rooms, cut a hole 2&frac12;&Prime; in diameter. The reason for
this is stated on <a href="#Page_88">page 88</a>, paragraph 2. The slanting roof should
project 2&frac12;&Prime; all around. Finish it with a flat top as shown in the
first cut on <a href="#Page_128">page 128</a>. Add posts 1&Prime;&times;1&Prime;&times;4&Prime; on which to staple
wire or doweling as perches for the martins. Fasten these little
posts to the flat roof by screws from beneath, before nailing it to
the house.</p>
<p>Now fit the pole to the central space and screw it securely to the
cleats under the base, and the pole with the house on it is ready to
be set up. The martin house should be at least fifty feet away
from a tree or building, and fifteen feet above ground.</p>
<p>To mount the martin house so it can be easily let down to be
cleaned or to rout the English sparrows, place the two posts four
inches apart and have them at least six feet high. Set the pole
holding the martin house between them and secure it with two
bolts about four feet apart, the lower bolt being 1&frac12; feet from the
ground. To lower the house, remove the lower bolt and tilt the
pole, as shown in the second cut on <a href="#Page_128">page 128</a>. The posts should
be creosoted and sunk five feet in cement.</p>
<p>This cut shows a block and tackle being used to tilt the pole.
A further precaution against having the house crash to the ground
would be a shears made of rough two by four scantling, which can
be obtained in twelve-foot lengths. In making the shears, bolt
the scantlings two feet from the top with an ordinary half-inch
carriage bolt, and tie the bottoms so the legs will not spread too
much.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
